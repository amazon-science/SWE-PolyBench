# Prometheus

Prometheus is a FastAPI-based multi-agent backend service for intelligent, codebase-level operations, including answering questions, resolving issues, and reviewing pull requests. It uses a state machine–driven multi-agent workflow to ensure code quality through automated reviews, build verification, and test execution.
