Issue title:
Improve default ProGuard / R8 rules and Troubleshooting Guide

Issue description: 
# Problem solved by the feature
Improve the default ProGuard / R8 rules in `META-INF/proguard/gson.pro` added by #2397, and the Troubleshooting Guide.

# Feature description
I was testing the new default rules with an Android app and Kotlin classes, and there might be the following areas to improve.

### Troubleshooting Guide: `JsonIOException`: 'Abstract classes can't be instantiated!' (R8)

The Troubleshooting Guide currently suggests the following:
```
# Keep the no-args constructor of the deserialized class
-keepclassmembers class com.example.MyClass {
  <init>();
}
```

This means only the no-args constructor is kept, but not any other constructors. However, especially for Kotlin I assume it is common that classes don't have a no-args constructor because you might declare properties and the primary constructor at once, e.g. `class MyClass(val s: String)` (see [Kotlin documentation](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/classes.html#constructors)). Not sure though if using that is a good idea in combination with Gson because it then requires JDK Unsafe to create instances, but that is a different topic.

So there are two questions:
- Should the Troubleshooting Guide rather recommend `<init>(...);` (all constructors), so that the users don't experience issues with R8 anymore (but implicitly depend on JDK Unsafe; using `GsonBuilder.disableJdkUnsafe()` would cause Gson to fail with a different exception)
- Should the Troubleshooting Guide recommend `-keep` instead of `-keepclassmembers`. In case the `<init>` rule for the class properly matches a constructor it might not matter. But in case `<init>();` is used, but a no-args constructor does not exist, then `-keep` seems to at least have the side-effect that R8 does not make the class abstract (and then using JDK Unsafe an instance can be created).

### Troubleshooting Guide: Recommend `@Keep` for Android
Instead of configuring ProGuard / R8 rules, it might be easier for Android developers to use `@Keep` on the corresponding class or constructor, see https://developer.android.com/studio/write/annotations#keep

### Preventing R8 from making classes abstract / removing no-args constructor

It would be good if we could adjust the default rules to avoid the "Abstract classes can't be instantiated!" exception (for most cases) in the first place.

There is probably no general way to detect if a class might be used with Gson, but the most reliable variant might be to keep the constructor if any of the Gson annotations is used by a class.

This can probably be achieved with an [`-if` rule](https://www.guardsquare.com/manual/configuration/usage#if) (see also [answers to this Stack Overflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/q/63162818)). For example:
```
# If class has fields with `@SerializedName` annotation keep its constructors
-if class * {
  @com.google.gson.annotations.SerializedName <fields>;
}
-keep class <1> {
  <init>(...);
}
```
(duplicated for all Gson annotations)

But it looks like this is not enough, maybe because there is no `-keep` (or `-keepclasseswithmembers`) rule for the class in the first place so `-if` somehow has no effect? You additionally need the following (duplicated for all Gson annotations probably):
```
-keepclasseswithmembers class * {
  @com.google.gson.annotations.SerializedName <fields>;
}
```
Only then the class is not made abstract and the constructor is properly kept...

(As side note: Having only the `-keepclasseswithmembers ... { @SerializedName }` above, but not the `-if ... -keep` seems to prevent R8 from making the class abstract, but still removes all constructors, so users would be dependent on JDK Unsafe then.)

Or similar to https://github.com/google/gson/issues/2379#issuecomment-1564517629 maybe the following would work as well:
```
-keepclasseswithmembers class * {
  <init>(...);
  @com.google.gson.annotations.SerializedName <fields>;
}
```
There is however probably no need for the `-if` rule shown in the original comment, unless that has some special effect, see https://github.com/google/gson/pull/2397#issuecomment-1575236086.

### R8 makes class abstract but still keeps constructors

It also looks like the Android app build creates (for some reason) additional constructors / keeps constructors even when the class is made abstract. Due to this, the Troubleshooting Guide URLs are unfortunately not included in the exception messages (they are only added at the moment when there are no constructors).
Not really sure why these constructors exist in the first place and are kept even when the class is made abstract. In the R8 integration test of Gson this behavior was not seen.

Maybe we should remove the `getDeclaredConstructors().length == 0` check if the class is abstract and always refer to the Troubleshooting Guide. The guide would have to be adjusted then though to also properly cover the case where the class was indeed abstract in the source code.

All aggregated context for the queries:
--- BEGIN AGGREGATED CONTEXT ---

--- END AGGREGATED CONTEXT ---

Analyze if the current context is sufficient to complete the user query by considering:
1. Do you understand the full scope and requirements of the user query?
2. Do you have access to all relevant code that needs to be examined or modified?
3. Are all critical dependencies and their interfaces visible?
4. Is there enough context about the system architecture and design patterns?
5. Do you have access to relevant documentation or tests if needed?

Only request additional context if essential information is missing. Ensure you're not requesting:
- Information already provided in previous queries
- Nice-to-have but non-essential details
- Implementation details that aren't relevant to the current task

If additional context is needed:
- Be specific about what you're looking for
- Consider both code and documentation that might be relevant

IMPORTANT:
- Try to avoid asking for the SAME or very similar information as previous queries, because these queries have already been asked and satisfied.

Issue title:
Improve default ProGuard / R8 rules and Troubleshooting Guide

Issue description: 
# Problem solved by the feature
Improve the default ProGuard / R8 rules in `META-INF/proguard/gson.pro` added by #2397, and the Troubleshooting Guide.

# Feature description
I was testing the new default rules with an Android app and Kotlin classes, and there might be the following areas to improve.

### Troubleshooting Guide: `JsonIOException`: 'Abstract classes can't be instantiated!' (R8)

The Troubleshooting Guide currently suggests the following:
```
# Keep the no-args constructor of the deserialized class
-keepclassmembers class com.example.MyClass {
  <init>();
}
```

This means only the no-args constructor is kept, but not any other constructors. However, especially for Kotlin I assume it is common that classes don't have a no-args constructor because you might declare properties and the primary constructor at once, e.g. `class MyClass(val s: String)` (see [Kotlin documentation](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/classes.html#constructors)). Not sure though if using that is a good idea in combination with Gson because it then requires JDK Unsafe to create instances, but that is a different topic.

So there are two questions:
- Should the Troubleshooting Guide rather recommend `<init>(...);` (all constructors), so that the users don't experience issues with R8 anymore (but implicitly depend on JDK Unsafe; using `GsonBuilder.disableJdkUnsafe()` would cause Gson to fail with a different exception)
- Should the Troubleshooting Guide recommend `-keep` instead of `-keepclassmembers`. In case the `<init>` rule for the class properly matches a constructor it might not matter. But in case `<init>();` is used, but a no-args constructor does not exist, then `-keep` seems to at least have the side-effect that R8 does not make the class abstract (and then using JDK Unsafe an instance can be created).

### Troubleshooting Guide: Recommend `@Keep` for Android
Instead of configuring ProGuard / R8 rules, it might be easier for Android developers to use `@Keep` on the corresponding class or constructor, see https://developer.android.com/studio/write/annotations#keep

### Preventing R8 from making classes abstract / removing no-args constructor

It would be good if we could adjust the default rules to avoid the "Abstract classes can't be instantiated!" exception (for most cases) in the first place.

There is probably no general way to detect if a class might be used with Gson, but the most reliable variant might be to keep the constructor if any of the Gson annotations is used by a class.

This can probably be achieved with an [`-if` rule](https://www.guardsquare.com/manual/configuration/usage#if) (see also [answers to this Stack Overflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/q/63162818)). For example:
```
# If class has fields with `@SerializedName` annotation keep its constructors
-if class * {
  @com.google.gson.annotations.SerializedName <fields>;
}
-keep class <1> {
  <init>(...);
}
```
(duplicated for all Gson annotations)

But it looks like this is not enough, maybe because there is no `-keep` (or `-keepclasseswithmembers`) rule for the class in the first place so `-if` somehow has no effect? You additionally need the following (duplicated for all Gson annotations probably):
```
-keepclasseswithmembers class * {
  @com.google.gson.annotations.SerializedName <fields>;
}
```
Only then the class is not made abstract and the constructor is properly kept...

(As side note: Having only the `-keepclasseswithmembers ... { @SerializedName }` above, but not the `-if ... -keep` seems to prevent R8 from making the class abstract, but still removes all constructors, so users would be dependent on JDK Unsafe then.)

Or similar to https://github.com/google/gson/issues/2379#issuecomment-1564517629 maybe the following would work as well:
```
-keepclasseswithmembers class * {
  <init>(...);
  @com.google.gson.annotations.SerializedName <fields>;
}
```
There is however probably no need for the `-if` rule shown in the original comment, unless that has some special effect, see https://github.com/google/gson/pull/2397#issuecomment-1575236086.

### R8 makes class abstract but still keeps constructors

It also looks like the Android app build creates (for some reason) additional constructors / keeps constructors even when the class is made abstract. Due to this, the Troubleshooting Guide URLs are unfortunately not included in the exception messages (they are only added at the moment when there are no constructors).
Not really sure why these constructors exist in the first place and are kept even when the class is made abstract. In the R8 integration test of Gson this behavior was not seen.

Maybe we should remove the `getDeclaredConstructors().length == 0` check if the class is abstract and always refer to the Troubleshooting Guide. The guide would have to be adjusted then though to also properly cover the case where the class was indeed abstract in the source code.

Any additional feedback is highly appreciated!

--- END ORIGINAL QUERY ---



All aggregated context for the queries:
--- BEGIN AGGREGATED CONTEXT ---

--- END AGGREGATED CONTEXT ---

Analyze if the current context is sufficient to complete the user query by considering:
1. Do you understand the full scope and requirements of the user query?
2. Do you have access to all relevant code that needs to be examined or modified?
3. Are all critical dependencies and their interfaces visible?
4. Is there enough context about the system architecture and design patterns?
5. Do you have access to relevant documentation or tests if needed?

Only request additional context if essential information is missing. Ensure you're not requesting:
- Information already provided in previous queries
- Nice-to-have but non-essential details
- Implementation details that aren't relevant to the current task

If additional context is needed:
- Be specific about what you're looking for
- Consider both code and documentation that might be relevant

IMPORTANT:
- Try to avoid asking for the SAME or very similar information as previous queries, because these queries have already been asked and satisfied.

8. ## <a id="class-cast-exception"></a> `ClassCastException` when using deserialized object
9. 
10. **Symptom:** `ClassCastException` is thrown when accessing an object deserialized by Gson
11. 
12. **Reason:** Your code is most likely not type-safe
13. 
14. **Solution:** Make sure your code adheres to the following:
15. 
16. - Avoid raw types: Instead of calling `fromJson(..., List.class)`, create for example a `TypeToken<List<MyClass>>`.
17.   See the [user guide](UserGuide.md#collections-examples) for more information.
18. - When using `TypeToken` prefer the `Gson.fromJson` overloads with `TypeToken` parameter such as [`fromJson(Reader, TypeToken)`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/Gson.html#fromJson(java.io.Reader,com.google.gson.reflect.TypeToken)).
19.   The overloads with `Type` parameter do not provide any type-safety guarantees.
20. - When using `TypeToken` make sure you don't capture a type variable. For example avoid something like `new TypeToken<List<T>>()` (where `T` is a type variable). Due to Java type erasure the actual type of `T` is not available at runtime. Refactor your code to pass around `TypeToken` instances or use [`TypeToken.getParameterized(...)`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/reflect/TypeToken.html#getParameterized(java.lang.reflect.Type,java.lang.reflect.Type...)), for example `TypeToken.getParameterized(List.class, elementClass)`.
21. 
22. ## <a id="reflection-inaccessible"></a> `InaccessibleObjectException`: 'module ... does not "opens ..." to unnamed module'
23. 
24. **Symptom:** An exception with a message in the form 'module ... does not "opens ..." to unnamed module' is thrown
25. 
26. **Reason:** You use Gson by accident to access internal fields of third-party classes
27. 
28. **Solution:** Write custom Gson [`TypeAdapter`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html) implementations for the affected classes or change the type of your data. If this occurs for a field in one of your classes which you did not actually want to serialize or deserialize in the first place, you can exclude that field, see the [user guide](UserGuide.md#excluding-fields-from-serialization-and-deserialization).
29. 
30. **Explanation:**
31. 
32. When no built-in adapter for a type exists and no custom adapter has been registered, Gson falls back to using reflection to access the fields of a class (including `private` ones). Most likely you are seeing this error because you (by accident) rely on the reflection-based adapter for third-party classes. That should be avoided because you make yourself dependent on the implementation details of these classes which could change at any point. For the JDK it is also not possible anymore to access internal fields using reflection starting with JDK 17, see [JEP 403](https://openjdk.org/jeps/403).
33. 
34. If you want to prevent using reflection on third-party classes in the future you can write your own [`ReflectionAccessFilter`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/ReflectionAccessFilter.html) or use one of the predefined ones, such as `ReflectionAccessFilter.BLOCK_ALL_PLATFORM`.
35. 
36. ## <a id="reflection-inaccessible-to-module-gson"></a> `InaccessibleObjectException`: 'module ... does not "opens ..." to module com.google.gson'
37. 
38. **Symptom:** An exception with a message in the form 'module ... does not "opens ..." to module com.google.gson' is thrown
39. 
40. **Reason:**
41. 
42. - If the reported package is your own package then you have not configured the module declaration of your project to allow Gson to use reflection on your classes.
43. - If the reported package is from a third party library or the JDK see [this troubleshooting point](#inaccessibleobjectexception-module--does-not-opens--to-unnamed-module).
44. 
45. **Solution:** Make sure the `module-info.java` file of your project allows Gson to use reflection on your classes, for example:
46. 
47. ```java
48. module mymodule {
49.     requires com.google.gson;
50. 
51.     opens mypackage to com.google.gson;
52. }
53. ```
54. 
55. Or in case this occurs for a field in one of your classes which you did not actually want to serialize or deserialize in the first place, you can exclude that field, see the [user guide](UserGuide.md#excluding-fields-from-serialization-and-deserialization).
56. 
57. ## <a id="android-app-random-names"></a> Android app not working in Release mode; random property names
58. 
59. **Symptom:** Your Android app is working fine in Debug mode but fails in Release mode and the JSON properties have seemingly random names such as `a`, `b`, ...
60. 
61. **Reason:** You probably have not configured ProGuard / R8 correctly
62. 
63. **Solution:** Make sure you have configured ProGuard / R8 correctly to preserve the names of your fields. See the [Android example](examples/android-proguard-example/README.md) for more information.
64. 
65. ## <a id="android-app-broken-after-app-update"></a> Android app unable to parse JSON after app update
66. 
67. **Symptom:** You released a new version of your Android app and it fails to parse JSON data created by the previous version of your app
68. 
69. **Reason:** You probably have not configured ProGuard / R8 correctly; probably the fields names are being obfuscated and their naming changed between the versions of your app
70. 
71. **Solution:** Make sure you have configured ProGuard / R8 correctly to preserve the names of your fields. See the [Android example](examples/android-proguard-example/README.md) for more information.
72. 
73. If you want to preserve backward compatibility for you app you can use [`@SerializedName`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/annotations/SerializedName.html) on the fields to specify the obfuscated name as alternate, for example: `@SerializedName(value = "myprop", alternate = "a")`
74. 
75. Normally ProGuard and R8 produce a mapping file, this makes it easier to find out the obfuscated field names instead of having to find them out through trial and error or other means. See the [Android Studio user guide](https://developer.android.com/studio/build/shrink-code.html#retracing) for more information.
76. 
77. ## <a id="default-field-values-missing"></a> Default field values not present after deserialization
78. 
79. **Symptom:** You have assign default values to fields but after deserialization the fields have their standard value (such as `null` or `0`)
80. 
81. **Reason:** Gson cannot invoke the constructor of your class and falls back to JDK `Unsafe` (or similar means)
82. 
83. **Solution:** Make sure that the class:
84. 
85. - is `static` (explicitly or implicitly when it is a top-level class)
86. - has a no-args constructor
87. 
88. Otherwise Gson will by default try to use JDK `Unsafe` or similar means to create an instance of your class without invoking the constructor and without running any initializers. You can also disable that behavior through [`GsonBuilder.disableJdkUnsafe()`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.html#disableJdkUnsafe()) to notice such issues early on.
89. 
90. ## <a id="anonymous-local-null"></a> `null` values for anonymous and local classes
91. 
92. **Symptom:** Objects of a class are always serialized as JSON `null` / always deserialized as Java `null`
93. 
94. **Reason:** The class you are serializing or deserializing is an anonymous or a local class (or you have specified a custom `ExclusionStrategy`)
95. 
96. **Solution:** Convert the class to a `static` nested class. If the class is already `static` make sure you have not specified a Gson `ExclusionStrategy` which might exclude the class.
97. 
98. Notes:
99. 
100. - "double brace-initialization" also creates anonymous classes
101. - Local record classes (feature added in Java 16) are supported by Gson and are not affected by this
102. 
103. ## <a id="map-key-wrong-json"></a> Map keys having unexpected format in JSON
104. 
105. **Symptom:** JSON output for `Map` keys is unexpected / cannot be deserialized again
106. 
107. **Reason:** The `Map` key type is 'complex' and you have not configured the `GsonBuilder` properly
108. 
109. **Solution:** Use [`GsonBuilder.enableComplexMapKeySerialization()`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.html#enableComplexMapKeySerialization()). See also the [user guide](UserGuide.md#maps-examples) for more information.
110. 
111. ## <a id="malformed-json"></a> Parsing JSON fails with `MalformedJsonException`
112. 
113. **Symptom:** JSON parsing fails with `MalformedJsonException`
114. 
115. **Reason:** The JSON data is actually malformed
116. 
117. **Solution:** During debugging, log the JSON data right before calling Gson methods or set a breakpoint to inspect the data and make sure it has the expected format. Sometimes APIs might return HTML error pages (instead of JSON data) when reaching rate limits or when other errors occur. Also read the location information of the `MalformedJsonException` exception message, it indicates where exactly in the document the malformed data was detected, including the [JSONPath](https://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/).
118. 
119. For example, let's assume you want to deserialize the following JSON data:
120. 
121. ```json
122. {
123.   "languages": [
124.     "English",
125.     "French",
126.   ]
127. }
128. ```
129. 
130. This will fail with an exception similar to this one: `MalformedJsonException: Use JsonReader.setLenient(true) to accept malformed JSON at line 5 column 4 path $.languages[2]`  
131. The problem here is the trailing comma (`,`) after `"French"`, trailing commas are not allowed by the JSON specification. The location information "line 5 column 4" points to the `]` in the JSON data (with some slight inaccuracies) because Gson expected another value after `,` instead of the closing `]`. The JSONPath `$.languages[2]` in the exception message also points there: `$.` refers to the root object, `languages` refers to its member of that name and `[2]` refers to the (missing) third value in the JSON array value of that member (numbering starts at 0, so it is `[2]` instead of `[3]`).  
132. The proper solution here is to fix the malformed JSON data.
133. 
134. To spot syntax errors in the JSON data easily you can open it in an editor with support for JSON, for example Visual Studio Code. It will highlight within the JSON data the error location and show why the JSON data is considered invalid.
135. 
136. ## <a id="number-parsed-as-double"></a> Integral JSON number is parsed as `double`
137. 
138. **Symptom:** JSON data contains an integral number such as `45` but Gson returns it as `double`
139. 
140. **Reason:** When parsing a JSON number as `Object`, Gson will by default create always return a `double`
141. 
142. **Solution:** Use [`GsonBuilder.setObjectToNumberStrategy`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.html#setObjectToNumberStrategy(com.google.gson.ToNumberStrategy)) to specify what type of number should be returned
143. 
144. ## <a id="default-lenient"></a> Malformed JSON not rejected
145. 
146. **Symptom:** Gson parses malformed JSON without throwing any exceptions
147. 
148. **Reason:** Due to legacy reasons Gson performs parsing by default in lenient mode
149. 
150. **Solution:** See [`Gson` class documentation](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/Gson.html#default-lenient) section "Lenient JSON handling"
151. 
152. Note: Even in non-lenient mode Gson deviates slightly from the JSON specification, see [`JsonReader.setLenient`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/stream/JsonReader.html#setLenient(boolean)) for more details.
153. 
154. ## <a id="unexpected-json-structure"></a> `IllegalStateException`: "Expected ... but was ..."
155. 
156. **Symptom:** An `IllegalStateException` with a message in the form "Expected ... but was ..." is thrown
157. 
158. **Reason:** The JSON data does not have the correct format
159. 
160. **Solution:** Make sure that your classes correctly model the JSON data. Also during debugging log the JSON data right before calling Gson methods or set a breakpoint to inspect the data and make sure it has the expected format. Read the location information of the exception message, it indicates where exactly in the document the error occurred, including the [JSONPath](https://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/).
161. 
162. For example, let's assume you have the following Java class:
163. 
164. ```java
165. class WebPage {
166.     String languages;
167. }
168. ```
169. 
170. And you want to deserialize the following JSON data:
171. 
172. ```json
173. {
174.   "languages": ["English", "French"]
175. }
176. ```
177. 
178. This will fail with an exception similar to this one: `IllegalStateException: Expected a string but was BEGIN_ARRAY at line 2 column 17 path $.languages`  
179. This means Gson expected a JSON string value but found the beginning of a JSON array (`[`). The location information "line 2 column 17" points to the `[` in the JSON data (with some slight inaccuracies), so does the JSONPath `$.languages` in the exception message. It refers to the `languages` member of the root object (`$.`).  
180. The solution here is to change in the `WebPage` class the field `String languages` to `List<String> languages`.
181. 
182. ## <a id="adapter-not-null-safe"></a> `IllegalStateException`: "Expected ... but was NULL"
183. 
184. **Symptom:** An `IllegalStateException` with a message in the form "Expected ... but was NULL" is thrown
185. 
186. **Reason:**
187. 
188. - A built-in adapter does not support JSON null values
189. - You have written a custom `TypeAdapter` which does not properly handle JSON null values
190. 
191. **Solution:** If this occurs for a custom adapter you wrote, add code similar to the following at the beginning of its `read` method:
192. 
193. ```java
194. @Override
195. public MyClass read(JsonReader in) throws IOException {
196.     if (in.peek() == JsonToken.NULL) {
197.         in.nextNull();
198.         return null;
199.     }
200. 
201.     ...
202. }
203. ```
204. 
205. Alternatively you can call [`nullSafe()`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html#nullSafe()) on the adapter instance you created.
206. 
207. ## <a id="serialize-nulls"></a> Properties missing in JSON
208. 
209. **Symptom:** Properties are missing in the JSON output
210. 
211. **Reason:** Gson by default omits JSON null from the output (or: ProGuard / R8 is not configured correctly and removed unused fields)
212. 
213. **Solution:** Use [`GsonBuilder.serializeNulls()`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.html#serializeNulls())
214. 
215. Note: Gson does not support anonymous and local classes and will serialize them as JSON null, see the [related troubleshooting point](#null-values-for-anonymous-and-local-classes).
216. 
217. ## <a id="android-internal-fields"></a> JSON output changes for newer Android versions
218. 
219. **Symptom:** The JSON output differs when running on newer Android versions
220. 
221. **Reason:** You use Gson by accident to access internal fields of Android classes
222. 
223. **Solution:** Write custom Gson [`TypeAdapter`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html) implementations for the affected classes or change the type of your data
224. 
225. **Explanation:**
226. 
227. When no built-in adapter for a type exists and no custom adapter has been registered, Gson falls back to using reflection to access the fields of a class (including `private` ones). Most likely you are experiencing this issue because you (by accident) rely on the reflection-based adapter for Android classes. That should be avoided because you make yourself dependent on the implementation details of these classes which could change at any point.
228. 
229. If you want to prevent using reflection on third-party classes in the future you can write your own [`ReflectionAccessFilter`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/ReflectionAccessFilter.html) or use one of the predefined ones, such as `ReflectionAccessFilter.BLOCK_ALL_PLATFORM`.
230. 
231. ## <a id="json-static-fields"></a> JSON output contains values of `static` fields
232. 
233. **Symptom:** The JSON output contains values of `static` fields
234. 
235. **Reason:** You used `GsonBuilder.excludeFieldsWithModifiers` to overwrite the default excluded modifiers
236. 
237. **Solution:** When calling `GsonBuilder.excludeFieldsWithModifiers` you overwrite the default excluded modifiers. Therefore, you have to explicitly exclude `static` fields if desired. This can be done by adding `Modifier.STATIC` as additional argument.
238. 
239. ## <a id="no-such-method-error"></a> `NoSuchMethodError` when calling Gson methods
240. 
241. **Symptom:** A `java.lang.NoSuchMethodError` is thrown when trying to call certain Gson methods
242. 
243. **Reason:**
244. 
245. - You have multiple versions of Gson on your classpath
246. - Or, the Gson version you compiled against is different from the one on your classpath
247. - Or, you are using a code shrinking tool such as ProGuard or R8 which removed methods from Gson
248. 
249. **Solution:** First disable any code shrinking tools such as ProGuard or R8 and check if the issue persists. If not, you have to tweak the configuration of that tool to not modify Gson classes. Otherwise verify that the Gson JAR on your classpath is the same you are compiling against, and that there is only one Gson JAR on your classpath. See [this Stack Overflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/q/227486) to find out where a class is loaded from. For example, for debugging you could include the following code:
250. 
251. ```java
252. System.out.println(Gson.class.getProtectionDomain().getCodeSource().getLocation());
253. ```
254. 
255. If that fails with a `NullPointerException` you have to try one of the other ways to find out where a class is loaded from.
256. 
257. ## <a id="duplicate-fields"></a> `IllegalArgumentException`: 'Class ... declares multiple JSON fields named '...''
258. 
259. **Symptom:** An exception with the message 'Class ... declares multiple JSON fields named '...'' is thrown
260. 
261. **Reason:**
262. 
263. - The name you have specified with a [`@SerializedName`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/annotations/SerializedName.html) annotation for a field collides with the name of another field
264. - The [`FieldNamingStrategy`](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/FieldNamingStrategy.html) you have specified produces conflicting field names
265. - A field of your class has the same name as the field of a superclass
266. 
267. Gson prevents multiple fields with the same name because during deserialization it would be ambiguous for which field the JSON data should be deserialized. For serialization it would cause the same field to appear multiple times in JSON. While the JSON specification permits this, it is likely that the application parsing the JSON data will not handle it correctly.
268. 
269. **Solution:** First identify the fields with conflicting names based on the exception message. Then decide if you want to rename one of them using the [`@SerializedName`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/annotations/SerializedName.html) annotation, or if you want to [exclude](UserGuide.md#excluding-fields-from-serialization-and-deserialization) one of them. When excluding one of the fields you have to include it for both serialization and deserialization (even if your application only performs one of these actions) because the duplicate field check cannot differentiate between these actions.
270. 
271. ## <a id="java-lang-class-unsupported"></a> `UnsupportedOperationException` when serializing or deserializing `java.lang.Class`
272. 
273. **Symptom:** An `UnsupportedOperationException` is thrown when trying to serialize or deserialize `java.lang.Class`
274. 
275. **Reason:** Gson intentionally does not permit serializing and deserializing `java.lang.Class` for security reasons. Otherwise a malicious user could make your application load an arbitrary class from the classpath and, depending on what your application does with the `Class`, in the worst case perform a remote code execution attack.
276. 
277. **Solution:** First check if you really need to serialize or deserialize a `Class`. Often it is possible to use string aliases and then map them to the known `Class`; you could write a custom [`TypeAdapter`](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html) to do this. If the `Class` values are not known in advance, try to introduce a common base class or interface for all these classes and then verify that the deserialized class is a subclass. For example assuming the base class is called `MyBaseClass`, your custom `TypeAdapter` should load the class like this:
278. 
279. ```java
280. Class.forName(jsonString, false, getClass().getClassLoader()).asSubclass(MyBaseClass.class)
281. ```
282. 
283. This will not initialize arbitrary classes, and it will throw a `ClassCastException` if the loaded class is not the same as or a subclass of `MyBaseClass`.
284. 
285. ## <a id="type-token-raw"></a> `IllegalStateException`: 'TypeToken must be created with a type argument' <br> `RuntimeException`: 'Missing type parameter'
286. 
287. **Symptom:** An `IllegalStateException` with the message 'TypeToken must be created with a type argument' is thrown.  
288. For older Gson versions a `RuntimeException` with message 'Missing type parameter' is thrown.
289. 
290. **Reason:**
291. 
292. - You created a `TypeToken` without type argument, for example `new TypeToken() {}` (note the missing `<...>`). You always have to provide the type argument, for example like this: `new TypeToken<List<String>>() {}`. Normally the compiler will also emit a 'raw types' warning when you forget the `<...>`.
293. - You are using a code shrinking tool such as ProGuard or R8 (Android app builds normally have this enabled by default) but have not configured it correctly for usage with Gson.
294. 
295. **Solution:** When you are using a code shrinking tool such as ProGuard or R8 you have to adjust your configuration to include the following rules:
296. 
297. ```
298. # Keep generic signatures; needed for correct type resolution
299. -keepattributes Signature
300. 
301. # Keep class TypeToken (respectively its generic signature)
302. -keep class com.google.gson.reflect.TypeToken { *; }
303. 
304. # Keep any (anonymous) classes extending TypeToken
305. -keep class * extends com.google.gson.reflect.TypeToken
306. ```
307. 
308. See also the [Android example](examples/android-proguard-example/README.md) for more information.
309. 
310. Note: For newer Gson versions these rules might be applied automatically; make sure you are using the latest Gson version and the latest version of the code shrinking tool.
311. 
312. ## <a id="r8-abstract-class"></a> `JsonIOException`: 'Abstract classes can't be instantiated!' (R8)
313. 
314. **Symptom:** A `JsonIOException` with the message 'Abstract classes can't be instantiated!' is thrown; the class mentioned in the exception message is not actually `abstract` in your source code, and you are using the code shrinking tool R8 (Android app builds normally have this configured by default).
315. 
316. **Reason:** The code shrinking tool R8 performs optimizations where it removes the no-args constructor from a class and makes the class `abstract`. Due to this Gson cannot create an instance of the class.
317. 
318. **Solution:** Make sure the class has a no-args constructor, then adjust your R8 configuration file to keep the constructor of the class. For example:
319. 
320. ```
321. # Keep the no-args constructor of the deserialized class
322. -keepclassmembers class com.example.MyClass {
323.   <init>();
324. }
325. ```
326. 
327. For Android you can add this rule to the `proguard-rules.pro` file, see also the [Android documentation](https://developer.android.com/build/shrink-code#keep-code). In case the class name in the exception message is obfuscated, see the Android documentation about [retracing](https://developer.android.com/build/shrink-code#retracing).
328. 
329. Note: If the class which you are trying to deserialize is actually abstract, then this exception is probably unrelated to R8 and you will have to implement a custom [`InstanceCreator`](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/InstanceCreator.html) or [`TypeAdapter`](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html) which creates an instance of a non-abstract subclass of the class.

39. ## Overview
40. 
41. Gson is a Java library that can be used to convert Java Objects into their JSON representation. It can also be used to convert a JSON string to an equivalent Java object.
42. 
43. Gson can work with arbitrary Java objects including pre-existing objects that you do not have source code of.
44. 
45. ## Goals for Gson
46. 
47. * Provide easy to use mechanisms like `toString()` and constructor (factory method) to convert Java to JSON and vice-versa
48. * Allow pre-existing unmodifiable objects to be converted to and from JSON
49. * Allow custom representations for objects
50. * Support arbitrarily complex objects
51. * Generate compact and readable JSON output
52. 
53. ## Gson Performance and Scalability
54. 
55. Here are some metrics that we obtained on a desktop (dual opteron, 8GB RAM, 64-bit Ubuntu) running lots of other things along-with the tests. You can rerun these tests by using the class [`PerformanceTest`](gson/src/test/java/com/google/gson/metrics/PerformanceTest.java).
56. 
57. * Strings: Deserialized strings of over 25MB without any problems (see `disabled_testStringDeserializationPerformance` method in `PerformanceTest`)
58. * Large collections:
59.   * Serialized a collection of 1.4 million objects (see `disabled_testLargeCollectionSerialization` method in `PerformanceTest`)
60.   * Deserialized a collection of 87,000 objects (see `disabled_testLargeCollectionDeserialization` in `PerformanceTest`)
61. * Gson 1.4 raised the deserialization limit for byte arrays and collection to over 11MB from 80KB.
62. 
63. Note: Delete the `disabled_` prefix to run these tests. We use this prefix to prevent running these tests every time we run JUnit tests.
64. 
65. ## Gson Users
66. 
67. Gson was originally created for use inside Google where it is currently used in a number of projects. It is now used by a number of public projects and companies.
68. 
69. ## Using Gson
70. 
71. The primary class to use is [`Gson`](gson/src/main/java/com/google/gson/Gson.java) which you can just create by calling `new Gson()`. There is also a class [`GsonBuilder`](gson/src/main/java/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.java) available that can be used to create a Gson instance with various settings like version control and so on.
72. 
73. The Gson instance does not maintain any state while invoking JSON operations. So, you are free to reuse the same object for multiple JSON serialization and deserialization operations.
74. 
75. ## Using Gson with Gradle/Android
76. 
77. ```gradle
78. dependencies {
79.     implementation 'com.google.code.gson:gson:2.10.1'
80. }
81. ```
82. 
83. ## Using Gson with Maven
84. 
85. To use Gson with Maven2/3, you can use the Gson version available in Maven Central by adding the following dependency:
86. 
87. ```xml
88. <dependencies>
89.     <!--  Gson: Java to JSON conversion -->
90.     <dependency>
91.       <groupId>com.google.code.gson</groupId>
92.       <artifactId>gson</artifactId>
93.       <version>2.10.1</version>
94.       <scope>compile</scope>
95.     </dependency>
96. </dependencies>
97. ```
98. 
99. That is it, now your Maven project is Gson enabled.
100. 
101. ### Primitives Examples
102. 
103. ```java
104. // Serialization
105. Gson gson = new Gson();
106. gson.toJson(1);            // ==> 1
107. gson.toJson("abcd");       // ==> "abcd"
108. gson.toJson(new Long(10)); // ==> 10
109. int[] values = { 1 };
110. gson.toJson(values);       // ==> [1]
111. 
112. // Deserialization
113. int i = gson.fromJson("1", int.class);
114. Integer intObj = gson.fromJson("1", Integer.class);
115. Long longObj = gson.fromJson("1", Long.class);
116. Boolean boolObj = gson.fromJson("false", Boolean.class);
117. String str = gson.fromJson("\"abc\"", String.class);
118. String[] strArray = gson.fromJson("[\"abc\"]", String[].class);
119. ```
120. 
121. ### Object Examples
122. 
123. ```java
124. class BagOfPrimitives {
125.   private int value1 = 1;
126.   private String value2 = "abc";
127.   private transient int value3 = 3;
128.   BagOfPrimitives() {
129.     // no-args constructor
130.   }
131. }
132. 
133. // Serialization
134. BagOfPrimitives obj = new BagOfPrimitives();
135. Gson gson = new Gson();
136. String json = gson.toJson(obj);
137. 
138. // ==> {"value1":1,"value2":"abc"}
139. ```
140. 
141. Note that you can not serialize objects with circular references since that will result in infinite recursion.
142. 
143. ```java
144. // Deserialization
145. BagOfPrimitives obj2 = gson.fromJson(json, BagOfPrimitives.class);
146. // ==> obj2 is just like obj
147. ```
148. 
149. #### **Finer Points with Objects**
150. 
151. * It is perfectly fine (and recommended) to use private fields.
152. * There is no need to use any annotations to indicate a field is to be included for serialization and deserialization. All fields in the current class (and from all super classes) are included by default.
153. * If a field is marked transient, (by default) it is ignored and not included in the JSON serialization or deserialization.
154. * This implementation handles nulls correctly.
155.   * While serializing, a null field is omitted from the output.
156.   * While deserializing, a missing entry in JSON results in setting the corresponding field in the object to its default value: null for object types, zero for numeric types, and false for booleans.
157. * If a field is _synthetic_, it is ignored and not included in JSON serialization or deserialization.
158. * Fields corresponding to the outer classes in inner classes are ignored and not included in serialization or deserialization.
159. * Anonymous and local classes are excluded. They will be serialized as JSON `null` and when deserialized their JSON value is ignored and `null` is returned. Convert the classes to `static` nested classes to enable serialization and deserialization for them.
160. 
161. ### Nested Classes (including Inner Classes)
162. 
163. Gson can serialize static nested classes quite easily.
164. 
165. Gson can also deserialize static nested classes. However, Gson can **not** automatically deserialize the **pure inner classes since their no-args constructor also need a reference to the containing Object** which is not available at the time of deserialization. You can address this problem by either making the inner class static or by providing a custom InstanceCreator for it. Here is an example:
166. 
167. ```java
168. public class A {
169.   public String a;
170. 
171.   class B {
172. 
173.     public String b;
174. 
175.     public B() {
176.       // No args constructor for B
177.     }
178.   }
179. }
180. ```
181. 
182. **NOTE**: The above class B can not (by default) be serialized with Gson.
183. 
184. Gson can not deserialize `{"b":"abc"}` into an instance of B since the class B is an inner class. If it was defined as static class B then Gson would have been able to deserialize the string. Another solution is to write a custom instance creator for B.
185. 
186. ```java
187. public class InstanceCreatorForB implements InstanceCreator<A.B> {
188.   private final A a;
189.   public InstanceCreatorForB(A a)  {
190.     this.a = a;
191.   }
192.   public A.B createInstance(Type type) {
193.     return a.new B();
194.   }
195. }
196. ```
197. 
198. The above is possible, but not recommended.
199. 
200. ### Array Examples
201. 
202. ```java
203. Gson gson = new Gson();
204. int[] ints = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
205. String[] strings = {"abc", "def", "ghi"};
206. 
207. // Serialization
208. gson.toJson(ints);     // ==> [1,2,3,4,5]
209. gson.toJson(strings);  // ==> ["abc", "def", "ghi"]
210. 
211. // Deserialization
212. int[] ints2 = gson.fromJson("[1,2,3,4,5]", int[].class);
213. // ==> ints2 will be same as ints
214. ```
215. 
216. We also support multi-dimensional arrays, with arbitrarily complex element types.
217. 
218. ### Collections Examples
219. 
220. ```java
221. Gson gson = new Gson();
222. Collection<Integer> ints = Arrays.asList(1,2,3,4,5);
223. 
224. // Serialization
225. String json = gson.toJson(ints);  // ==> [1,2,3,4,5]
226. 
227. // Deserialization
228. TypeToken<Collection<Integer>> collectionType = new TypeToken<Collection<Integer>>(){};
229. // Note: For older Gson versions it is necessary to use `collectionType.getType()` as argument below,
230. // this is however not type-safe and care must be taken to specify the correct type for the local variable
231. Collection<Integer> ints2 = gson.fromJson(json, collectionType);
232. // ==> ints2 is same as ints
233. ```
234. 
235. Fairly hideous: note how we define the type of collection.
236. Unfortunately, there is no way to get around this in Java.
237. 
238. #### Collections Limitations
239. 
240. Gson can serialize collection of arbitrary objects but can not deserialize from it, because there is no way for the user to indicate the type of the resulting object. Instead, while deserializing, the Collection must be of a specific, generic type.
241. This makes sense, and is rarely a problem when following good Java coding practices.
242. 
243. ### Maps Examples
244. 
245. Gson by default serializes any `java.util.Map` implementation as a JSON object. Because JSON objects only support strings as member names, Gson converts the Map keys to strings by calling `toString()` on them, and using `"null"` for `null` keys:
246. 
247. ```java
248. Gson gson = new Gson();
249. Map<String, String> stringMap = new LinkedHashMap<>();
250. stringMap.put("key", "value");
251. stringMap.put(null, "null-entry");
252. 
253. // Serialization
254. String json = gson.toJson(stringMap); // ==> {"key":"value","null":"null-entry"}
255. 
256. Map<Integer, Integer> intMap = new LinkedHashMap<>();
257. intMap.put(2, 4);
258. intMap.put(3, 6);
259. 
260. // Serialization
261. String json = gson.toJson(intMap); // ==> {"2":4,"3":6}
262. ```
263. 
264. For deserialization Gson uses the `read` method of the `TypeAdapter` registered for the Map key type. Similar to the Collection example shown above, for deserialization a `TypeToken` has to be used to tell Gson what types the Map keys and values have:
265. 
266. ```java
267. Gson gson = new Gson();
268. TypeToken<Map<String, String>> mapType = new TypeToken<Map<String, String>>(){};
269. String json = "{\"key\": \"value\"}";
270. 
271. // Deserialization
272. // Note: For older Gson versions it is necessary to use `mapType.getType()` as argument below,
273. // this is however not type-safe and care must be taken to specify the correct type for the local variable
274. Map<String, String> stringMap = gson.fromJson(json, mapType);
275. // ==> stringMap is {key=value}
276. ```
277. 
278. Gson also supports using complex types as Map keys. This feature can be enabled with [`GsonBuilder.enableComplexMapKeySerialization()`](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.html#enableComplexMapKeySerialization()). If enabled, Gson uses the `write` method of the `TypeAdapter` registered for the Map key type to serialize the keys, instead of using `toString()`. When any of the keys is serialized by the adapter as JSON array or JSON object, Gson will serialize the complete Map as JSON array, consisting of key-value pairs (encoded as JSON array). Otherwise, if none of the keys is serialized as a JSON array or JSON object, Gson will use a JSON object to encode the Map:
279. 
280. ```java
281. class PersonName {
282.   String firstName;
283.   String lastName;
284. 
285.   PersonName(String firstName, String lastName) {
286.     this.firstName = firstName;
287.     this.lastName = lastName;
288.   }
289. 
290.   // ... equals and hashCode
291. }
292. 
293. Gson gson = new GsonBuilder().enableComplexMapKeySerialization().create();
294. Map<PersonName, Integer> complexMap = new LinkedHashMap<>();
295. complexMap.put(new PersonName("John", "Doe"), 30);
296. complexMap.put(new PersonName("Jane", "Doe"), 35);
297. 
298. // Serialization; complex map is serialized as a JSON array containing key-value pairs (as JSON arrays)
299. String json = gson.toJson(complexMap);
300. // ==> [[{"firstName":"John","lastName":"Doe"},30],[{"firstName":"Jane","lastName":"Doe"},35]]
301. 
302. Map<String, String> stringMap = new LinkedHashMap<>();
303. stringMap.put("key", "value");
304. // Serialization; non-complex map is serialized as a regular JSON object
305. String json = gson.toJson(stringMap); // ==> {"key":"value"}
306. ```
307. 
308. **Important:** Because Gson by default uses `toString()` to serialize Map keys, this can lead to malformed encoded keys or can cause mismatch between serialization and deserialization of the keys, for example when `toString()` is not properly implemented. A workaround for this can be to use `enableComplexMapKeySerialization()` to make sure the `TypeAdapter` registered for the Map key type is used for deserialization _and_ serialization. As shown in the example above, when none of the keys are serialized by the adapter as JSON array or JSON object, the Map is serialized as a regular JSON object, as desired.
309. 
310. Note that when deserializing enums as Map keys, if Gson is unable to find an enum constant with a matching `name()` value respectively `@SerializedName` annotation, it falls back to looking up the enum constant by its `toString()` value. This is to work around the issue described above, but only applies to enum constants.
311. 
312. ### Serializing and Deserializing Generic Types
313. 
314. When you call `toJson(obj)`, Gson calls `obj.getClass()` to get information on the fields to serialize. Similarly, you can typically pass `MyClass.class` object in the `fromJson(json, MyClass.class)` method. This works fine if the object is a non-generic type. However, if the object is of a generic type, then the Generic type information is lost because of Java Type Erasure. Here is an example illustrating the point:
315. 
316. ```java
317. class Foo<T> {
318.   T value;
319. }
320. Gson gson = new Gson();
321. Foo<Bar> foo = new Foo<Bar>();
322. gson.toJson(foo); // May not serialize foo.value correctly
323. 
324. gson.fromJson(json, foo.getClass()); // Fails to deserialize foo.value as Bar
325. ```
326. 
327. The above code fails to interpret value as type Bar because Gson invokes `foo.getClass()` to get its class information, but this method returns a raw class, `Foo.class`. This means that Gson has no way of knowing that this is an object of type `Foo<Bar>`, and not just plain `Foo`.
328. 
329. You can solve this problem by specifying the correct parameterized type for your generic type. You can do this by using the [`TypeToken`](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/reflect/TypeToken.html) class.
330. 
331. ```java
332. Type fooType = new TypeToken<Foo<Bar>>() {}.getType();
333. gson.toJson(foo, fooType);
334. 
335. gson.fromJson(json, fooType);
336. ```
337. 
338. The idiom used to get `fooType` actually defines an anonymous local inner class containing a method `getType()` that returns the fully parameterized type.
339. 
340. ### Serializing and Deserializing Collection with Objects of Arbitrary Types
341. 
342. Sometimes you are dealing with JSON array that contains mixed types. For example:
343. `['hello',5,{name:'GREETINGS',source:'guest'}]`
344. 
345. The equivalent `Collection` containing this is:
346. 
347. ```java
348. Collection collection = new ArrayList();
349. collection.add("hello");
350. collection.add(5);
351. collection.add(new Event("GREETINGS", "guest"));
352. ```
353. 
354. where the `Event` class is defined as:
355. 
356. ```java
357. class Event {
358.   private String name;
359.   private String source;
360.   private Event(String name, String source) {
361.     this.name = name;
362.     this.source = source;
363.   }
364. }
365. ```
366. 
367. You can serialize the collection with Gson without doing anything specific: `toJson(collection)` would write out the desired output.
368. 
369. However, deserialization with `fromJson(json, Collection.class)` will not work since Gson has no way of knowing how to map the input to the types. Gson requires that you provide a genericised version of collection type in `fromJson()`. So, you have three options:
370. 
371. 1. Use Gson's parser API (low-level streaming parser or the DOM parser JsonParser) to parse the array elements and then use `Gson.fromJson()` on each of the array elements.This is the preferred approach. [Here is an example](extras/src/main/java/com/google/gson/extras/examples/rawcollections/RawCollectionsExample.java) that demonstrates how to do this.
372. 
373. 2. Register a type adapter for `Collection.class` that looks at each of the array members and maps them to appropriate objects. The disadvantage of this approach is that it will screw up deserialization of other collection types in Gson.
374. 
375. 3. Register a type adapter for `MyCollectionMemberType` and use `fromJson()` with `Collection<MyCollectionMemberType>`.
376. 
377. This approach is practical only if the array appears as a top-level element or if you can change the field type holding the collection to be of type `Collection<MyCollectionMemberType>`.
378. 
379. ### Built-in Serializers and Deserializers
380. 
381. Gson has built-in serializers and deserializers for commonly used classes whose default representation may be inappropriate, for instance
382. 
383. * `java.net.URL` to match it with strings like `"https://github.com/google/gson/"`
384. * `java.net.URI` to match it with strings like `"/google/gson/"`
385. 
386. For many more, see the internal class [`TypeAdapters`](gson/src/main/java/com/google/gson/internal/bind/TypeAdapters.java).
387. 
388. You can also find source code for some commonly used classes such as JodaTime at [this page](https://sites.google.com/site/gson/gson-type-adapters-for-common-classes-1).
389. 
390. ### Custom Serialization and Deserialization
391. 
392. Sometimes default representation is not what you want. This is often the case when dealing with library classes (DateTime, etc).
393. Gson allows you to register your own custom serializers and deserializers. This is done by defining two parts:
394. 
395. * JSON Serializers: Need to define custom serialization for an object
396. * JSON Deserializers: Needed to define custom deserialization for a type
397. 
398. * Instance Creators: Not needed if no-args constructor is available or a deserializer is registered
399. 
400. ```java
401. GsonBuilder gson = new GsonBuilder();
402. gson.registerTypeAdapter(MyType2.class, new MyTypeAdapter());
403. gson.registerTypeAdapter(MyType.class, new MySerializer());
404. gson.registerTypeAdapter(MyType.class, new MyDeserializer());
405. gson.registerTypeAdapter(MyType.class, new MyInstanceCreator());
406. ```
407. 
408. `registerTypeAdapter` call checks if the type adapter implements more than one of these interfaces and register it for all of them.
409. 
410. #### Writing a Serializer
411. 
412. Here is an example of how to write a custom serializer for JodaTime `DateTime` class.
413. 
414. ```java
415. private class DateTimeSerializer implements JsonSerializer<DateTime> {
416.   public JsonElement serialize(DateTime src, Type typeOfSrc, JsonSerializationContext context) {
417.     return new JsonPrimitive(src.toString());
418.   }
419. }
420. ```
421. 
422. Gson calls `serialize()` when it runs into a `DateTime` object during serialization.
423. 
424. #### Writing a Deserializer
425. 
426. Here is an example of how to write a custom deserializer for JodaTime DateTime class.
427. 
428. ```java
429. private class DateTimeDeserializer implements JsonDeserializer<DateTime> {
430.   public DateTime deserialize(JsonElement json, Type typeOfT, JsonDeserializationContext context)
431.       throws JsonParseException {
432.     return new DateTime(json.getAsJsonPrimitive().getAsString());
433.   }
434. }
435. ```
436. 
437. Gson calls `deserialize` when it needs to deserialize a JSON string fragment into a DateTime object
438. 
439. **Finer points with Serializers and Deserializers**
440. 
441. Often you want to register a single handler for all generic types corresponding to a raw type
442. 
443. * For example, suppose you have an `Id` class for id representation/translation (i.e. an internal vs. external representation).
444. * `Id<T>` type that has same serialization for all generic types
445.   * Essentially write out the id value
446. * Deserialization is very similar but not exactly the same
447.   * Need to call `new Id(Class<T>, String)` which returns an instance of `Id<T>`
448. 
449. Gson supports registering a single handler for this. You can also register a specific handler for a specific generic type (say `Id<RequiresSpecialHandling>` needed special handling).
450. The `Type` parameter for the `toJson()` and `fromJson()` contains the generic type information to help you write a single handler for all generic types corresponding to the same raw type.
451. 
452. ### Writing an Instance Creator
453. 
454. While deserializing an Object, Gson needs to create a default instance of the class.
455. Well-behaved classes that are meant for serialization and deserialization should have a no-argument constructor.
456. 
457. * Doesn't matter whether public or private
458. 
459. Typically, Instance Creators are needed when you are dealing with a library class that does NOT define a no-argument constructor
460. 
461. **Instance Creator Example**
462. 
463. ```java
464. private class MoneyInstanceCreator implements InstanceCreator<Money> {
465.   public Money createInstance(Type type) {
466.     return new Money("1000000", CurrencyCode.USD);
467.   }
468. }
469. ```
470. 
471. Type could be of a corresponding generic type
472. 
473. * Very useful to invoke constructors which need specific generic type information
474. * For example, if the `Id` class stores the class for which the Id is being created
475. 
476. #### InstanceCreator for a Parameterized Type
477. 
478. Sometimes the type that you are trying to instantiate is a parameterized type. Generally, this is not a problem since the actual instance is of raw type. Here is an example:
479. 
480. ```java
481. class MyList<T> extends ArrayList<T> {
482. }
483. 
484. class MyListInstanceCreator implements InstanceCreator<MyList<?>> {
485.   @SuppressWarnings("unchecked")
486.   public MyList<?> createInstance(Type type) {
487.     // No need to use a parameterized list since the actual instance will have the raw type anyway.
488.     return new MyList();
489.   }
490. }
491. ```
492. 
493. However, sometimes you do need to create instance based on the actual parameterized type. In this case, you can use the type parameter being passed to the `createInstance` method. Here is an example:
494. 
495. ```java
496. public class Id<T> {
497.   private final Class<T> classOfId;
498.   private final long value;
499.   public Id(Class<T> classOfId, long value) {
500.     this.classOfId = classOfId;

Issue title:
Improve default ProGuard / R8 rules and Troubleshooting Guide

Issue description: 
# Problem solved by the feature
Improve the default ProGuard / R8 rules in `META-INF/proguard/gson.pro` added by #2397, and the Troubleshooting Guide.

# Feature description
I was testing the new default rules with an Android app and Kotlin classes, and there might be the following areas to improve.

### Troubleshooting Guide: `JsonIOException`: 'Abstract classes can't be instantiated!' (R8)

The Troubleshooting Guide currently suggests the following:
```
# Keep the no-args constructor of the deserialized class
-keepclassmembers class com.example.MyClass {
  <init>();
}
```

This means only the no-args constructor is kept, but not any other constructors. However, especially for Kotlin I assume it is common that classes don't have a no-args constructor because you might declare properties and the primary constructor at once, e.g. `class MyClass(val s: String)` (see [Kotlin documentation](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/classes.html#constructors)). Not sure though if using that is a good idea in combination with Gson because it then requires JDK Unsafe to create instances, but that is a different topic.

So there are two questions:
- Should the Troubleshooting Guide rather recommend `<init>(...);` (all constructors), so that the users don't experience issues with R8 anymore (but implicitly depend on JDK Unsafe; using `GsonBuilder.disableJdkUnsafe()` would cause Gson to fail with a different exception)
- Should the Troubleshooting Guide recommend `-keep` instead of `-keepclassmembers`. In case the `<init>` rule for the class properly matches a constructor it might not matter. But in case `<init>();` is used, but a no-args constructor does not exist, then `-keep` seems to at least have the side-effect that R8 does not make the class abstract (and then using JDK Unsafe an instance can be created).

### Troubleshooting Guide: Recommend `@Keep` for Android
Instead of configuring ProGuard / R8 rules, it might be easier for Android developers to use `@Keep` on the corresponding class or constructor, see https://developer.android.com/studio/write/annotations#keep

### Preventing R8 from making classes abstract / removing no-args constructor

It would be good if we could adjust the default rules to avoid the "Abstract classes can't be instantiated!" exception (for most cases) in the first place.

There is probably no general way to detect if a class might be used with Gson, but the most reliable variant might be to keep the constructor if any of the Gson annotations is used by a class.

This can probably be achieved with an [`-if` rule](https://www.guardsquare.com/manual/configuration/usage#if) (see also [answers to this Stack Overflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/q/63162818)). For example:
```
# If class has fields with `@SerializedName` annotation keep its constructors
-if class * {
  @com.google.gson.annotations.SerializedName <fields>;
}
-keep class <1> {
  <init>(...);
}
```
(duplicated for all Gson annotations)

But it looks like this is not enough, maybe because there is no `-keep` (or `-keepclasseswithmembers`) rule for the class in the first place so `-if` somehow has no effect? You additionally need the following (duplicated for all Gson annotations probably):
```
-keepclasseswithmembers class * {
  @com.google.gson.annotations.SerializedName <fields>;
}
```
Only then the class is not made abstract and the constructor is properly kept...

(As side note: Having only the `-keepclasseswithmembers ... { @SerializedName }` above, but not the `-if ... -keep` seems to prevent R8 from making the class abstract, but still removes all constructors, so users would be dependent on JDK Unsafe then.)

Or similar to https://github.com/google/gson/issues/2379#issuecomment-1564517629 maybe the following would work as well:
```
-keepclasseswithmembers class * {
  <init>(...);
  @com.google.gson.annotations.SerializedName <fields>;
}
```
There is however probably no need for the `-if` rule shown in the original comment, unless that has some special effect, see https://github.com/google/gson/pull/2397#issuecomment-1575236086.

### R8 makes class abstract but still keeps constructors

It also looks like the Android app build creates (for some reason) additional constructors / keeps constructors even when the class is made abstract. Due to this, the Troubleshooting Guide URLs are unfortunately not included in the exception messages (they are only added at the moment when there are no constructors).
Not really sure why these constructors exist in the first place and are kept even when the class is made abstract. In the R8 integration test of Gson this behavior was not seen.

Maybe we should remove the `getDeclaredConstructors().length == 0` check if the class is abstract and always refer to the Troubleshooting Guide. The guide would have to be adjusted then though to also properly cover the case where the class was indeed abstract in the source code.

58. 
59. **Symptom:** Your Android app is working fine in Debug mode but fails in Release mode and the JSON properties have seemingly random names such as `a`, `b`, ...
60. 
61. **Reason:** You probably have not configured ProGuard / R8 correctly
62. 
63. **Solution:** Make sure you have configured ProGuard / R8 correctly to preserve the names of your fields. See the [Android example](examples/android-proguard-example/README.md) for more information.

65. ## <a id="android-app-broken-after-app-update"></a> Android app unable to parse JSON after app update
66. 
67. **Symptom:** You released a new version of your Android app and it fails to parse JSON data created by the previous version of your app
68. 
69. **Reason:** You probably have not configured ProGuard / R8 correctly; probably the fields names are being obfuscated and their naming changed between the versions of your app
70. 
71. **Solution:** Make sure you have configured ProGuard / R8 correctly to preserve the names of your fields. See the [Android example](examples/android-proguard-example/README.md) for more information.
72. 
73. If you want to preserve backward compatibility for you app you can use [`@SerializedName`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/annotations/SerializedName.html) on the fields to specify the obfuscated name as alternate, for example: `@SerializedName(value = "myprop", alternate = "a")`
74. 
75. Normally ProGuard and R8 produce a mapping file, this makes it easier to find out the obfuscated field names instead of having to find them out through trial and error or other means. See the [Android Studio user guide](https://developer.android.com/studio/build/shrink-code.html#retracing) for more information.

Content:
77. ## <a id="default-field-values-missing"></a> Default field values not present after deserialization
78. 
79. **Symptom:** You have assign default values to fields but after deserialization the fields have their standard value (such as `null` or `0`)
80. 
81. **Reason:** Gson cannot invoke the constructor of your class and falls back to JDK `Unsafe` (or similar means)
82. 
83. **Solution:** Make sure that the class:
84. 
85. - is `static` (explicitly or implicitly when it is a top-level class)
86. - has a no-args constructor
87. 
88. Otherwise Gson will by default try to use JDK `Unsafe` or similar means to create an instance of your class without invoking the constructor and without running any initializers. You can also disable that behavior through [`GsonBuilder.disableJdkUnsafe()`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.html#disableJdkUnsafe()) to notice such issues early on.

Content:
211. **Reason:** Gson by default omits JSON null from the output (or: ProGuard / R8 is not configured correctly and removed unused fields)
212. 
213. **Solution:** Use [`GsonBuilder.serializeNulls()`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.html#serializeNulls())
214. 
215. Note: Gson does not support anonymous and local classes and will serialize them as JSON null, see the [related troubleshooting point](#null-values-for-anonymous-and-local-classes).

Line number range: 239 - 256
Content:
239. ## <a id="no-such-method-error"></a> `NoSuchMethodError` when calling Gson methods
240. 
241. **Symptom:** A `java.lang.NoSuchMethodError` is thrown when trying to call certain Gson methods
242. 
243. **Reason:**
244. 
245. - You have multiple versions of Gson on your classpath
246. - Or, the Gson version you compiled against is different from the one on your classpath
247. - Or, you are using a code shrinking tool such as ProGuard or R8 which removed methods from Gson
248. 
249. **Solution:** First disable any code shrinking tools such as ProGuard or R8 and check if the issue persists. If not, you have to tweak the configuration of that tool to not modify Gson classes. Otherwise verify that the Gson JAR on your classpath is the same you are compiling against, and that there is only one Gson JAR on your classpath. See [this Stack Overflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/q/227486) to find out where a class is loaded from. For example, for debugging you could include the following code:
250. 
251. ```java
252. System.out.println(Gson.class.getProtectionDomain().getCodeSource().getLocation());
253. ```
254. 
255. If that fails with a `NullPointerException` you have to try one of the other ways to find out where a class is loaded from.

Content:
285. ## <a id="type-token-raw"></a> `IllegalStateException`: 'TypeToken must be created with a type argument' <br> `RuntimeException`: 'Missing type parameter'
286. 
287. **Symptom:** An `IllegalStateException` with the message 'TypeToken must be created with a type argument' is thrown.  
288. For older Gson versions a `RuntimeException` with message 'Missing type parameter' is thrown.
289. 
290. **Reason:**
291. 
292. - You created a `TypeToken` without type argument, for example `new TypeToken() {}` (note the missing `<...>`). You always have to provide the type argument, for example like this: `new TypeToken<List<String>>() {}`. Normally the compiler will also emit a 'raw types' warning when you forget the `<...>`.
293. - You are using a code shrinking tool such as ProGuard or R8 (Android app builds normally have this enabled by default) but have not configured it correctly for usage with Gson.
294. 
295. **Solution:** When you are using a code shrinking tool such as ProGuard or R8 you have to adjust your configuration to include the following rules:
296. 
297. ```
298. # Keep generic signatures; needed for correct type resolution
299. -keepattributes Signature
300. 
301. # Keep class TypeToken (respectively its generic signature)
302. -keep class com.google.gson.reflect.TypeToken { *; }
303. 
304. # Keep any (anonymous) classes extending TypeToken
305. -keep class * extends com.google.gson.reflect.TypeToken
306. ```
307. 
308. See also the [Android example](examples/android-proguard-example/README.md) for more information.
309. 
310. Note: For newer Gson versions these rules might be applied automatically; make sure you are using the latest Gson version and the latest version of the code shrinking tool.

312. ## <a id="r8-abstract-class"></a> `JsonIOException`: 'Abstract classes can't be instantiated!' (R8)
313. 
314. **Symptom:** A `JsonIOException` with the message 'Abstract classes can't be instantiated!' is thrown; the class mentioned in the exception message is not actually `abstract` in your source code, and you are using the code shrinking tool R8 (Android app builds normally have this configured by default).
315. 
316. **Reason:** The code shrinking tool R8 performs optimizations where it removes the no-args constructor from a class and makes the class `abstract`. Due to this Gson cannot create an instance of the class.
317. 
318. **Solution:** Make sure the class has a no-args constructor, then adjust your R8 configuration file to keep the constructor of the class. For example:
319. 
320. ```
321. # Keep the no-args constructor of the deserialized class
322. -keepclassmembers class com.example.MyClass {
323.   <init>();
324. }
325. ```
326. 
327. For Android you can add this rule to the `proguard-rules.pro` file, see also the [Android documentation](https://developer.android.com/build/shrink-code#keep-code). In case the class name in the exception message is obfuscated, see the Android documentation about [retracing](https://developer.android.com/build/shrink-code#retracing).
328. 
329. Note: If the class which you are trying to deserialize is actually abstract, then this exception is probably unrelated to R8 and you will have to implement a custom [`InstanceCreator`](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/InstanceCreator.html) or [`TypeAdapter`](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html) which creates an instance of a non-abstract subclass of the class.

1. Do you understand the full scope and requirements of the user query?
2. Do you have access to all relevant code that needs to be examined or modified?
3. Are all critical dependencies and their interfaces visible?
4. Is there enough context about the system architecture and design patterns?
5. Do you have access to relevant documentation or tests if needed?

Only request additional context if essential information is missing. Ensure you're not requesting:
- Information already provided in previous queries
- Nice-to-have but non-essential details
- Implementation details that aren't relevant to the current task

If additional context is needed:
- Be specific about what you're looking for
- Consider both code and documentation that might be relevant

IMPORTANT:
- Try to avoid asking for the SAME or very similar information as previous queries, because these queries have already been asked and satisfied.

Normally the compiler will also emit a \'raw types\' warning when you forget the `<...>`.\n293. - You are using a code shrinking tool such as ProGuard or R8 (Android app builds normally have this enabled by default) but have not configured it correctly for usage with Gson.\n294. \n295. **Solution:** When you are using a code shrinking tool such as ProGuard or R8 you have to adjust your configuration to include the following rules:\n296. \n297. ```\n298. # Keep generic signatures; needed for correct type resolution\n299. -keepattributes Signature\n300. \n301. # Keep class TypeToken (respectively its generic signature)\n302. -keep class com.google.gson.reflect.TypeToken { *; }\n303. \n304. # Keep any (anonymous) classes extending TypeToken\n305. -keep class * extends com.google.gson.reflect.TypeToken\n306. ```\n307. \n308. See also the [Android example](examples/android-proguard-example/README.md) for more information.\n309. \n310. Note: For newer Gson versions these rules might be applied automatically; make sure you are using the latest Gson version and the latest version of the code shrinking tool.\n311.

Due to this Gson cannot create an instance of the class.\n317. \n318. **Solution:** Make sure the class has a no-args constructor, then adjust your R8 configuration file to keep the constructor of the class. For example:\n319. \n320. ```\n321. # Keep the no-args constructor of the deserialized class\n322. -keepclassmembers class com.example.MyClass {\n323.   <init>();\n324. }\n325. ```\n326. \n327.

--- BEGIN ISSUE ---
Issue title:
Improve default ProGuard / R8 rules and Troubleshooting Guide

Issue description: 
# Problem solved by the feature
Improve the default ProGuard / R8 rules in `META-INF/proguard/gson.pro` added by #2397, and the Troubleshooting Guide.

# Feature description
I was testing the new default rules with an Android app and Kotlin classes, and there might be the following areas to improve.

### Troubleshooting Guide: `JsonIOException`: 'Abstract classes can't be instantiated!' (R8)

The Troubleshooting Guide currently suggests the following:
```
# Keep the no-args constructor of the deserialized class
-keepclassmembers class com.example.MyClass {
  <init>();
}
```

This means only the no-args constructor is kept, but not any other constructors. However, especially for Kotlin I assume it is common that classes don't have a no-args constructor because you might declare properties and the primary constructor at once, e.g. `class MyClass(val s: String)` (see [Kotlin documentation](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/classes.html#constructors)). Not sure though if using that is a good idea in combination with Gson because it then requires JDK Unsafe to create instances, but that is a different topic.

So there are two questions:
- Should the Troubleshooting Guide rather recommend `<init>(...);` (all constructors), so that the users don't experience issues with R8 anymore (but implicitly depend on JDK Unsafe; using `GsonBuilder.disableJdkUnsafe()` would cause Gson to fail with a different exception)
- Should the Troubleshooting Guide recommend `-keep` instead of `-keepclassmembers`. In case the `<init>` rule for the class properly matches a constructor it might not matter. But in case `<init>();` is used, but a no-args constructor does not exist, then `-keep` seems to at least have the side-effect that R8 does not make the class abstract (and then using JDK Unsafe an instance can be created).

### Troubleshooting Guide: Recommend `@Keep` for Android
Instead of configuring ProGuard / R8 rules, it might be easier for Android developers to use `@Keep` on the corresponding class or constructor, see https://developer.android.com/studio/write/annotations#keep

### Preventing R8 from making classes abstract / removing no-args constructor

It would be good if we could adjust the default rules to avoid the "Abstract classes can't be instantiated!" exception (for most cases) in the first place.

There is probably no general way to detect if a class might be used with Gson, but the most reliable variant might be to keep the constructor if any of the Gson annotations is used by a class.

This can probably be achieved with an [`-if` rule](https://www.guardsquare.com/manual/configuration/usage#if) (see also [answers to this Stack Overflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/q/63162818)). For example:
```
# If class has fields with `@SerializedName` annotation keep its constructors
-if class * {
  @com.google.gson.annotations.SerializedName <fields>;
}
-keep class <1> {
  <init>(...);
}
```
(duplicated for all Gson annotations)

But it looks like this is not enough, maybe because there is no `-keep` (or `-keepclasseswithmembers`) rule for the class in the first place so `-if` somehow has no effect? You additionally need the following (duplicated for all Gson annotations probably):
```
-keepclasseswithmembers class * {
  @com.google.gson.annotations.SerializedName <fields>;
}
```
Only then the class is not made abstract and the constructor is properly kept...

(As side note: Having only the `-keepclasseswithmembers ... { @SerializedName }` above, but not the `-if ... -keep` seems to prevent R8 from making the class abstract, but still removes all constructors, so users would be dependent on JDK Unsafe then.)

Or similar to https://github.com/google/gson/issues/2379#issuecomment-1564517629 maybe the following would work as well:
```
-keepclasseswithmembers class * {
  <init>(...);
  @com.google.gson.annotations.SerializedName <fields>;
}
```
There is however probably no need for the `-if` rule shown in the original comment, unless that has some special effect, see https://github.com/google/gson/pull/2397#issuecomment-1575236086.

### R8 makes class abstract but still keeps constructors

It also looks like the Android app build creates (for some reason) additional constructors / keeps constructors even when the class is made abstract. Due to this, the Troubleshooting Guide URLs are unfortunately not included in the exception messages (they are only added at the moment when there are no constructors).
Not really sure why these constructors exist in the first place and are kept even when the class is made abstract. In the R8 integration test of Gson this behavior was not seen.

Maybe we should remove the `getDeclaredConstructors().length == 0` check if the class is abstract and always refer to the Troubleshooting Guide. The guide would have to be adjusted then though to also properly cover the case where the class was indeed abstract in the source code.

Any additional feedback is highly appreciated!

--- END ISSUE ---

And we need to find relevant existing tests that can be used as regression tests for this issue.

OBJECTIVE: Find 8 relevant existing test cases that most likely to break existing functionality if this issue is fixed or new changes apply.
including ALL necessary imports, test setup, mocking, assertions, and any test method used in the test case.

<reasoning>
1. Analyze bug characteristics:
   - Core functionality being tested
   - Input parameters and configurations
   - Expected error conditions
   - Environmental dependencies

2. Search requirements:
   - Required imports and dependencies
   - Test files exercising similar functionality
   - Mock/fixture setup patterns
   - Assertion styles
   - Error handling tests

3. Focus areas:
   - All necessary imports (standard library, testing frameworks, mocking utilities)
   - Dependencies and third-party packages
   - Test setup and teardown
   - Mock object configuration
   - Network/external service simulation
   - Error condition verification
</reasoning>

REQUIREMENTS:
- Return 8 complete, self-contained test cases that most likely to break existing functionality if this issue is fixed or new changes apply.
- Must include the identification of the test case (e.g., class name and method name)
- Must preserve exact file paths and line numbers

<examples>
--- BEGIN ISSUE ---
Title: parse_iso8601 drops timezone information for 'Z' suffix
Body: The helper `parse_iso8601` in `utils/datetime.py` incorrectly returns a naive datetime when the input ends with 'Z' (UTC). For example, "2024-10-12T09:15:00Z" becomes a naive dt instead of timezone-aware UTC. This breaks downstream scheduling.
Expected: Return timezone-aware datetime in UTC for 'Z' inputs and preserve offsets like "+09:00".

### Troubleshooting Guide: `JsonIOException`: 'Abstract classes can't be instantiated!' (R8)

The Troubleshooting Guide currently suggests the following:
```
# Keep the no-args constructor of the deserialized class
-keepclassmembers class com.example.MyClass {
  <init>();
}
```

This means only the no-args constructor is kept, but not any other constructors. However, especially for Kotlin I assume it is common that classes don't have a no-args constructor because you might declare properties and the primary constructor at once, e.g. `class MyClass(val s: String)` (see [Kotlin documentation](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/classes.html#constructors)). Not sure though if using that is a good idea in combination with Gson because it then requires JDK Unsafe to create instances, but that is a different topic.

So there are two questions:
- Should the Troubleshooting Guide rather recommend `<init>(...);` (all constructors), so that the users don't experience issues with R8 anymore (but implicitly depend on JDK Unsafe; using `GsonBuilder.disableJdkUnsafe()` would cause Gson to fail with a different exception)
- Should the Troubleshooting Guide recommend `-keep` instead of `-keepclassmembers`. In case the `<init>` rule for the class properly matches a constructor it might not matter. But in case `<init>();` is used, but a no-args constructor does not exist, then `-keep` seems to at least have the side-effect that R8 does not make the class abstract (and then using JDK Unsafe an instance can be created).

### Troubleshooting Guide: Recommend `@Keep` for Android
Instead of configuring ProGuard / R8 rules, it might be easier for Android developers to use `@Keep` on the corresponding class or constructor, see https://developer.android.com/studio/write/annotations#keep

### Preventing R8 from making classes abstract / removing no-args constructor

It would be good if we could adjust the default rules to avoid the "Abstract classes can't be instantiated!" exception (for most cases) in the first place.

There is probably no general way to detect if a class might be used with Gson, but the most reliable variant might be to keep the constructor if any of the Gson annotations is used by a class.

This can probably be achieved with an [`-if` rule](https://www.guardsquare.com/manual/configuration/usage#if) (see also [answers to this Stack Overflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/q/63162818)). For example:
```
# If class has fields with `@SerializedName` annotation keep its constructors
-if class * {
  @com.google.gson.annotations.SerializedName <fields>;
}
-keep class <1> {
  <init>(...);
}
```
(duplicated for all Gson annotations)

But it looks like this is not enough, maybe because there is no `-keep` (or `-keepclasseswithmembers`) rule for the class in the first place so `-if` somehow has no effect? You additionally need the following (duplicated for all Gson annotations probably):
```
-keepclasseswithmembers class * {
  @com.google.gson.annotations.SerializedName <fields>;
}
```
Only then the class is not made abstract and the constructor is properly kept...

(As side note: Having only the `-keepclasseswithmembers ... { @SerializedName }` above, but not the `-if ... -keep` seems to prevent R8 from making the class abstract, but still removes all constructors, so users would be dependent on JDK Unsafe then.)

Or similar to https://github.com/google/gson/issues/2379#issuecomment-1564517629 maybe the following would work as well:
```
-keepclasseswithmembers class * {
  <init>(...);
  @com.google.gson.annotations.SerializedName <fields>;
}
```
There is however probably no need for the `-if` rule shown in the original comment, unless that has some special effect, see https://github.com/google/gson/pull/2397#issuecomment-1575236086.

### R8 makes class abstract but still keeps constructors

It also looks like the Android app build creates (for some reason) additional constructors / keeps constructors even when the class is made abstract. Due to this, the Troubleshooting Guide URLs are unfortunately not included in the exception messages (they are only added at the moment when there are no constructors).
Not really sure why these constructors exist in the first place and are kept even when the class is made abstract. In the R8 integration test of Gson this behavior was not seen.

Maybe we should remove the `getDeclaredConstructors().length == 0` check if the class is abstract and always refer to the Troubleshooting Guide. The guide would have to be adjusted then though to also properly cover the case where the class was indeed abstract in the source code.

   - Assertion styles
   - Error handling tests

3. Focus areas:
   - All necessary imports (standard library, testing frameworks, mocking utilities)
   - Dependencies and third-party packages
   - Test setup and teardown
   - Mock object configuration
   - Network/external service simulation

Title: parse_iso8601 drops timezone information for 'Z' suffix

All aggregated context for the queries:
--- BEGIN AGGREGATED CONTEXT ---

--- END AGGREGATED CONTEXT ---

Analyze if the current context is sufficient to complete the user query by considering:
1. Do you understand the full scope and requirements of the user query?
2. Do you have access to all relevant code that needs to be examined or modified?
3. Are all critical dependencies and their interfaces visible?
4. Is there enough context about the system architecture and design patterns?
5. Do you have access to relevant documentation or tests if needed?

Only request additional context if essential information is missing. Ensure you're not requesting:
- Information already provided in previous queries
- Nice-to-have but non-essential details
- Implementation details that aren't relevant to the current task

If additional context is needed:
- Be specific about what you're looking for
- Consider both code and documentation that might be relevant

IMPORTANT:
- Try to avoid asking for the SAME or very similar information as previous queries, because these queries have already been asked and satisfied.

We are currently solving the following issue within our repository. Here is the issue text:

Issue title:
Improve default ProGuard / R8 rules and Troubleshooting Guide

Issue description: 
# Problem solved by the feature
Improve the default ProGuard / R8 rules in `META-INF/proguard/gson.pro` added by #2397, and the Troubleshooting Guide.

# Feature description
I was testing the new default rules with an Android app and Kotlin classes, and there might be the following areas to improve.

### Troubleshooting Guide: `JsonIOException`: 'Abstract classes can't be instantiated!' (R8)

The Troubleshooting Guide currently suggests the following:
```
# Keep the no-args constructor of the deserialized class
-keepclassmembers class com.example.MyClass {
  <init>();
}
```

This means only the no-args constructor is kept, but not any other constructors. However, especially for Kotlin I assume it is common that classes don't have a no-args constructor because you might declare properties and the primary constructor at once, e.g. `class MyClass(val s: String)` (see [Kotlin documentation](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/classes.html#constructors)). Not sure though if using that is a good idea in combination with Gson because it then requires JDK Unsafe to create instances, but that is a different topic.

So there are two questions:
- Should the Troubleshooting Guide rather recommend `<init>(...);` (all constructors), so that the users don't experience issues with R8 anymore (but implicitly depend on JDK Unsafe; using `GsonBuilder.disableJdkUnsafe()` would cause Gson to fail with a different exception)
- Should the Troubleshooting Guide recommend `-keep` instead of `-keepclassmembers`. In case the `<init>` rule for the class properly matches a constructor it might not matter. But in case `<init>();` is used, but a no-args constructor does not exist, then `-keep` seems to at least have the side-effect that R8 does not make the class abstract (and then using JDK Unsafe an instance can be created).

### Troubleshooting Guide: Recommend `@Keep` for Android
Instead of configuring ProGuard / R8 rules, it might be easier for Android developers to use `@Keep` on the corresponding class or constructor, see https://developer.android.com/studio/write/annotations#keep

### Preventing R8 from making classes abstract / removing no-args constructor

-if class * {
  @com.google.gson.annotations.SerializedName <fields>;
}
-keep class <1> {
  <init>(...);

```
There is however probably no need for the `-if` rule shown in the original comment, unless that has some special effect, see https://github.com/google/gson/pull/2397#issuecomment-1575236086.

--- BEGIN QUERY ---
Please provide the contents (including line numbers) of test files under gson/src/test/java and shrinker-test/src/test/java which exercise R8/ProGuard behavior, constructor retention/Unsafe instantiation, Gson annotations (e.g., SerializedName), and JsonIOException for abstract class instantiation.
--- END QUERY ---

--- BEGIN EXTRA REQUIREMENTS ---
If sharing all files is too large, please provide the specific test classes/methods matching keywords: "R8", "ProGuard", "proguard", "gson.pro", "Unsafe", "ConstructorConstructor", "ObjectConstructor", "JsonIOException", "abstract", "SerializedName", "disableJdkUnsafe", with their imports and line ranges.
--- END EXTRA REQUIREMENTS ---

--- BEGIN PURPOSE ---
To identify and extract 8 existing tests most relevant to the ProGuard/R8 rules and constructor/abstract-class handling changes for use as regression tests.
--- END PURPOSE ---

The context or file content that you have seen so far (Some of the context may be IRRELEVANT to the query!!!):

This is the original user query:
--- BEGIN ORIGINAL QUERY ---
We are currently solving the following issue within our repository. Here is the issue text:

--- BEGIN ISSUE ---
Issue title:
Improve default ProGuard / R8 rules and Troubleshooting Guide

Issue description: 
# Problem solved by the feature
Improve the default ProGuard / R8 rules in `META-INF/proguard/gson.pro` added by #2397, and the Troubleshooting Guide.

# Feature description
I was testing the new default rules with an Android app and Kotlin classes, and there might be the following areas to improve.

### Troubleshooting Guide: `JsonIOException`: 'Abstract classes can't be instantiated!' (R8)

The Troubleshooting Guide currently suggests the following:
```
# Keep the no-args constructor of the deserialized class
-keepclassmembers class com.example.MyClass {
  <init>();
}
```

This means only the no-args constructor is kept, but not any other constructors. However, especially for Kotlin I assume it is common that classes don't have a no-args constructor because you might declare properties and the primary constructor at once, e.g. `class MyClass(val s: String)` (see [Kotlin documentation](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/classes.html#constructors)). Not sure though if using that is a good idea in combination with Gson because it then requires JDK Unsafe to create instances, but that is a different topic.

So there are two questions:
- Should the Troubleshooting Guide rather recommend `<init>(...);` (all constructors), so that the users don't experience issues with R8 anymore (but implicitly depend on JDK Unsafe; using `GsonBuilder.disableJdkUnsafe()` would cause Gson to fail with a different exception)
- Should the Troubleshooting Guide recommend `-keep` instead of `-keepclassmembers`. In case the `<init>` rule for the class properly matches a constructor it might not matter. But in case `<init>();` is used, but a no-args constructor does not exist, then `-keep` seems to at least have the side-effect that R8 does not make the class abstract (and then using JDK Unsafe an instance can be created).

### Troubleshooting Guide: Recommend `@Keep` for Android
Instead of configuring ProGuard / R8 rules, it might be easier for Android developers to use `@Keep` on the corresponding class or constructor, see https://developer.android.com/studio/write/annotations#keep

### Preventing R8 from making classes abstract / removing no-args constructor

It would be good if we could adjust the default rules to avoid the "Abstract classes can't be instantiated!" exception (for most cases) in the first place.

There is probably no general way to detect if a class might be used with Gson, but the most reliable variant might be to keep the constructor if any of the Gson annotations is used by a class.

This can probably be achieved with an [`-if` rule](https://www.guardsquare.com/manual/configuration/usage#if) (see also [answers to this Stack Overflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/q/63162818)). For example:
```
# If class has fields with `@SerializedName` annotation keep its constructors
-if class * {
  @com.google.gson.annotations.SerializedName <fields>;
}
-keep class <1> {
  <init>(...);
}
```
(duplicated for all Gson annotations)

But it looks like this is not enough, maybe because there is no `-keep` (or `-keepclasseswithmembers`) rule for the class in the first place so `-if` somehow has no effect? You additionally need the following (duplicated for all Gson annotations probably):
```
-keepclasseswithmembers class * {
  @com.google.gson.annotations.SerializedName <fields>;
}
```
Only then the class is not made abstract and the constructor is properly kept...

(As side note: Having only the `-keepclasseswithmembers ... { @SerializedName }` above, but not the `-if ... -keep` seems to prevent R8 from making the class abstract, but still removes all constructors, so users would be dependent on JDK Unsafe then.)

Or similar to https://github.com/google/gson/issues/2379#issuecomment-1564517629 maybe the following would work as well:
```
-keepclasseswithmembers class * {
  <init>(...);
  @com.google.gson.annotations.SerializedName <fields>;
}
```
There is however probably no need for the `-if` rule shown in the original comment, unless that has some special effect, see https://github.com/google/gson/pull/2397#issuecomment-1575236086.

### R8 makes class abstract but still keeps constructors

It also looks like the Android app build creates (for some reason) additional constructors / keeps constructors even when the class is made abstract. Due to this, the Troubleshooting Guide URLs are unfortunately not included in the exception messages (they are only added at the moment when there are no constructors).
Not really sure why these constructors exist in the first place and are kept even when the class is made abstract. In the R8 integration test of Gson this behavior was not seen.

Maybe we should remove the `getDeclaredConstructors().length == 0` check if the class is abstract and always refer to the Troubleshooting Guide. The guide would have to be adjusted then though to also properly cover the case where the class was indeed abstract in the source code.

Any additional feedback is highly appreciated!


Issue comments:

--- END ISSUE ---

And we need to find relevant existing tests that can be used as regression tests for this issue.

OBJECTIVE: Find 8 relevant existing test cases that most likely to break existing functionality if this issue is fixed or new changes apply.
including ALL necessary imports, test setup, mocking, assertions, and any test method used in the test case.

<reasoning>
1. Analyze bug characteristics:
   - Core functionality being tested
   - Input parameters and configurations
   - Expected error conditions
   - Environmental dependencies

2. Search requirements:
   - Required imports and dependencies
   - Test files exercising similar functionality
   - Mock/fixture setup patterns
   - Assertion styles
   - Error handling tests

3. Focus areas:
   - All necessary imports (standard library, testing frameworks, mocking utilities)
   - Dependencies and third-party packages
   - Test setup and teardown
   - Mock object configuration
   - Network/external service simulation
   - Error condition verification
</reasoning>

REQUIREMENTS:
- Return 8 complete, self-contained test cases that most likely to break existing functionality if this issue is fixed or new changes apply.
- Must include the identification of the test case (e.g., class name and method name)
- Must preserve exact file paths and line numbers

<examples>
--- BEGIN ISSUE ---
Title: parse_iso8601 drops timezone information for 'Z' suffix
Body: The helper `parse_iso8601` in `utils/datetime.py` incorrectly returns a naive datetime when the input ends with 'Z' (UTC). For example, "2024-10-12T09:15:00Z" becomes a naive dt instead of timezone-aware UTC. This breaks downstream scheduling.
Expected: Return timezone-aware datetime in UTC for 'Z' inputs and preserve offsets like "+09:00".
--- END ISSUE ---
--- BEGIN TEST CASES ---
File: tests/test_datetime.py
Line Number: 118-156
Content:

    dt = parse_iso8601(s)

    assert isinstance(dt, datetime.datetime)
    assert dt.tzinfo is not None
    # Use UTC comparison that works across pytz/zoneinfo
    assert dt.utcoffset() == datetime.timedelta(0)

def test_offset_preserved(self):
    # Offset like +09:00 should be preserved (e.g., Asia/Tokyo offset)

--- END AGGREGATED CONTEXT ---

Analyze if the current context is sufficient to complete the user query by considering:
1. Do you understand the full scope and requirements of the user query?
2. Do you have access to all relevant code that needs to be examined or modified?
3. Are all critical dependencies and their interfaces visible?
4. Is there enough context about the system architecture and design patterns?
5. Do you have access to relevant documentation or tests if needed?

Only request additional context if essential information is missing. Ensure you're not requesting:
- Information already provided in previous queries
- Nice-to-have but non-essential details
- Implementation details that aren't relevant to the current task

If additional context is needed:
- Be specific about what you're looking for
- Consider both code and documentation that might be relevant

IMPORTANT:
- Try to avoid asking for the SAME or very similar information as previous queries, because these queries have already been asked and satisfied.

Issue title:
Improve default ProGuard / R8 rules and Troubleshooting Guide

Issue description: 
# Problem solved by the feature
Improve the default ProGuard / R8 rules in `META-INF/proguard/gson.pro` added by #2397, and the Troubleshooting Guide.

# Feature description
I was testing the new default rules with an Android app and Kotlin classes, and there might be the following areas to improve.

### Troubleshooting Guide: `JsonIOException`: 'Abstract classes can't be instantiated!' (R8)

The Troubleshooting Guide currently suggests the following:
```
# Keep the no-args constructor of the deserialized class
-keepclassmembers class com.example.MyClass {
  <init>();
}
```

This means only the no-args constructor is kept, but not any other constructors. However, especially for Kotlin I assume it is common that classes don't have a no-args constructor because you might declare properties and the primary constructor at once, e.g. `class MyClass(val s: String)` (see [Kotlin documentation](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/classes.html#constructors)). Not sure though if using that is a good idea in combination with Gson because it then requires JDK Unsafe to create instances, but that is a different topic.

So there are two questions:
- Should the Troubleshooting Guide rather recommend `<init>(...);` (all constructors), so that the users don't experience issues with R8 anymore (but implicitly depend on JDK Unsafe; using `GsonBuilder.disableJdkUnsafe()` would cause Gson to fail with a different exception)
- Should the Troubleshooting Guide recommend `-keep` instead of `-keepclassmembers`. In case the `<init>` rule for the class properly matches a constructor it might not matter. But in case `<init>();` is used, but a no-args constructor does not exist, then `-keep` seems to at least have the side-effect that R8 does not make the class abstract (and then using JDK Unsafe an instance can be created).

### Troubleshooting Guide: Recommend `@Keep` for Android
Instead of configuring ProGuard / R8 rules, it might be easier for Android developers to use `@Keep` on the corresponding class or constructor, see https://developer.android.com/studio/write/annotations#keep

### Preventing R8 from making classes abstract / removing no-args constructor

It would be good if we could adjust the default rules to avoid the "Abstract classes can't be instantiated!" exception (for most cases) in the first place.

There is probably no general way to detect if a class might be used with Gson, but the most reliable variant might be to keep the constructor if any of the Gson annotations is used by a class.

This can probably be achieved with an [`-if` rule](https://www.guardsquare.com/manual/configuration/usage#if) (see also [answers to this Stack Overflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/q/63162818)). For example:
```
# If class has fields with `@SerializedName` annotation keep its constructors
-if class * {
  @com.google.gson.annotations.SerializedName <fields>;
}
-keep class <1> {
  <init>(...);
}
```
(duplicated for all Gson annotations)

But it looks like this is not enough, maybe because there is no `-keep` (or `-keepclasseswithmembers`) rule for the class in the first place so `-if` somehow has no effect? You additionally need the following (duplicated for all Gson annotations probably):
```
-keepclasseswithmembers class * {
  @com.google.gson.annotations.SerializedName <fields>;
}
```
Only then the class is not made abstract and the constructor is properly kept...

(As side note: Having only the `-keepclasseswithmembers ... { @SerializedName }` above, but not the `-if ... -keep` seems to prevent R8 from making the class abstract, but still removes all constructors, so users would be dependent on JDK Unsafe then.)

Or similar to https://github.com/google/gson/issues/2379#issuecomment-1564517629 maybe the following would work as well:
```
-keepclasseswithmembers class * {
  <init>(...);
  @com.google.gson.annotations.SerializedName <fields>;
}
```
There is however probably no need for the `-if` rule shown in the original comment, unless that has some special effect, see https://github.com/google/gson/pull/2397#issuecomment-1575236086.

### R8 makes class abstract but still keeps constructors

It also looks like the Android app build creates (for some reason) additional constructors / keeps constructors even when the class is made abstract. Due to this, the Troubleshooting Guide URLs are unfortunately not included in the exception messages (they are only added at the moment when there are no constructors).
Not really sure why these constructors exist in the first place and are kept even when the class is made abstract. In the R8 integration test of Gson this behavior was not seen.

Maybe we should remove the `getDeclaredConstructors().length == 0` check if the class is abstract and always refer to the Troubleshooting Guide. The guide would have to be adjusted then though to also properly cover the case where the class was indeed abstract in the source code.

Any additional feedback is highly appreciated!

Issue title:
Improve default ProGuard / R8 rules and Troubleshooting Guide

Issue description: 
# Problem solved by the feature
Improve the default ProGuard / R8 rules in `META-INF/proguard/gson.pro` added by #2397, and the Troubleshooting Guide.

# Feature description
I was testing the new default rules with an Android app and Kotlin classes, and there might be the following areas to improve.

### Troubleshooting Guide: `JsonIOException`: 'Abstract classes can't be instantiated!' (R8)

The Troubleshooting Guide currently suggests the following:
```
# Keep the no-args constructor of the deserialized class
-keepclassmembers class com.example.MyClass {
  <init>();
}
```

This means only the no-args constructor is kept, but not any other constructors. However, especially for Kotlin I assume it is common that classes don't have a no-args constructor because you might declare properties and the primary constructor at once, e.g. `class MyClass(val s: String)` (see [Kotlin documentation](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/classes.html#constructors)). Not sure though if using that is a good idea in combination with Gson because it then requires JDK Unsafe to create instances, but that is a different topic.

So there are two questions:
- Should the Troubleshooting Guide rather recommend `<init>(...);` (all constructors), so that the users don't experience issues with R8 anymore (but implicitly depend on JDK Unsafe; using `GsonBuilder.disableJdkUnsafe()` would cause Gson to fail with a different exception)
- Should the Troubleshooting Guide recommend `-keep` instead of `-keepclassmembers`. In case the `<init>` rule for the class properly matches a constructor it might not matter. But in case `<init>();` is used, but a no-args constructor does not exist, then `-keep` seems to at least have the side-effect that R8 does not make the class abstract (and then using JDK Unsafe an instance can be created).

### Troubleshooting Guide: Recommend `@Keep` for Android
Instead of configuring ProGuard / R8 rules, it might be easier for Android developers to use `@Keep` on the corresponding class or constructor, see https://developer.android.com/studio/write/annotations#keep

### Preventing R8 from making classes abstract / removing no-args constructor

It would be good if we could adjust the default rules to avoid the "Abstract classes can't be instantiated!" exception (for most cases) in the first place.

There is probably no general way to detect if a class might be used with Gson, but the most reliable variant might be to keep the constructor if any of the Gson annotations is used by a class.

This can probably be achieved with an [`-if` rule](https://www.guardsquare.com/manual/configuration/usage#if) (see also [answers to this Stack Overflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/q/63162818)). For example:
```
# If class has fields with `@SerializedName` annotation keep its constructors
-if class * {
  @com.google.gson.annotations.SerializedName <fields>;
}
-keep class <1> {
  <init>(...);
}
```
(duplicated for all Gson annotations)

But it looks like this is not enough, maybe because there is no `-keep` (or `-keepclasseswithmembers`) rule for the class in the first place so `-if` somehow has no effect? You additionally need the following (duplicated for all Gson annotations probably):
```
-keepclasseswithmembers class * {
  @com.google.gson.annotations.SerializedName <fields>;

Analyze if the current context is sufficient to complete the user query by considering:
1. Do you understand the full scope and requirements of the user query?
2. Do you have access to all relevant code that needs to be examined or modified?
3. Are all critical dependencies and their interfaces visible?
4. Is there enough context about the system architecture and design patterns?
5. Do you have access to relevant documentation or tests if needed?

Only request additional context if essential information is missing. Ensure you're not requesting:
- Information already provided in previous queries
- Nice-to-have but non-essential details
- Implementation details that aren't relevant to the current task

If additional context is needed:
- Be specific about what you're looking for
- Consider both code and documentation that might be relevant

IMPORTANT:
- Try to avoid asking for the SAME or very similar information as previous queries, because these queries have already been asked and satisfied.

Improve default ProGuard / R8 rules and Troubleshooting Guide

Issue description: 
# Problem solved by the feature
Improve the default ProGuard / R8 rules in `META-INF/proguard/gson.pro` added by #2397, and the Troubleshooting Guide.

# Feature description
I was testing the new default rules with an Android app and Kotlin classes, and there might be the following areas to improve.

### Troubleshooting Guide: `JsonIOException`: 'Abstract classes can't be instantiated!' (R8)

The Troubleshooting Guide currently suggests the following:
```
# Keep the no-args constructor of the deserialized class
-keepclassmembers class com.example.MyClass {
  <init>();
}
```

This means only the no-args constructor is kept, but not any other constructors. However, especially for Kotlin I assume it is common that classes don't have a no-args constructor because you might declare properties and the primary constructor at once, e.g. `class MyClass(val s: String)` (see [Kotlin documentation](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/classes.html#constructors)). Not sure though if using that is a good idea in combination with Gson because it then requires JDK Unsafe to create instances, but that is a different topic.

So there are two questions:
- Should the Troubleshooting Guide rather recommend `<init>(...);` (all constructors), so that the users don't experience issues with R8 anymore (but implicitly depend on JDK Unsafe; using `GsonBuilder.disableJdkUnsafe()` would cause Gson to fail with a different exception)
- Should the Troubleshooting Guide recommend `-keep` instead of `-keepclassmembers`. In case the `<init>` rule for the class properly matches a constructor it might not matter. But in case `<init>();` is used, but a no-args constructor does not exist, then `-keep` seems to at least have the side-effect that R8 does not make the class abstract (and then using JDK Unsafe an instance can be created).

### Troubleshooting Guide: Recommend `@Keep` for Android
Instead of configuring ProGuard / R8 rules, it might be easier for Android developers to use `@Keep` on the corresponding class or constructor, see https://developer.android.com/studio/write/annotations#keep

### Preventing R8 from making classes abstract / removing no-args constructor

It would be good if we could adjust the default rules to avoid the "Abstract classes can't be instantiated!" exception (for most cases) in the first place.

There is probably no general way to detect if a class might be used with Gson, but the most reliable variant might be to keep the constructor if any of the Gson annotations is used by a class.

This can probably be achieved with an [`-if` rule](https://www.guardsquare.com/manual/configuration/usage#if) (see also [answers to this Stack Overflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/q/63162818)). For example:
```
# If class has fields with `@SerializedName` annotation keep its constructors
-if class * {
  @com.google.gson.annotations.SerializedName <fields>;
}
-keep class <1> {
  <init>(...);
}
```
(duplicated for all Gson annotations)

But it looks like this is not enough, maybe because there is no `-keep` (or `-keepclasseswithmembers`) rule for the class in the first place so `-if` somehow has no effect? You additionally need the following (duplicated for all Gson annotations probably):
```
-keepclasseswithmembers class * {
  @com.google.gson.annotations.SerializedName <fields>;
}
```
Only then the class is not made abstract and the constructor is properly kept...

(As side note: Having only the `-keepclasseswithmembers ... { @SerializedName }` above, but not the `-if ... -keep` seems to prevent R8 from making the class abstract, but still removes all constructors, so users would be dependent on JDK Unsafe then.)

Or similar to https://github.com/google/gson/issues/2379#issuecomment-1564517629 maybe the following would work as well:
```
-keepclasseswithmembers class * {
  <init>(...);
  @com.google.gson.annotations.SerializedName <fields>;

There is however probably no need for the `-if` rule shown in the original comment, unless that has some special effect, see https://github.com/google/gson/pull/2397#issuecomment-1575236086.

### R8 makes class abstract but still keeps constructors

It also looks like the Android app build creates (for some reason) additional constructors / keeps constructors even when the class is made abstract. Due to this, the Troubleshooting Guide URLs are unfortunately not included in the exception messages (they are only added at the moment when there are no constructors).
Not really sure why these constructors exist in the first place and are kept even when the class is made abstract. In the R8 integration test of Gson this behavior was not seen.

Maybe we should remove the `getDeclaredConstructors().length == 0` check if the class is abstract and always refer to the Troubleshooting Guide. The guide would have to be adjusted then though to also properly cover the case where the class was indeed abstract in the source code.

Any additional feedback is highly appreciated!


Issue comments:


Find all relevant source code context and documentation needed to understand and implement this feature request.
Focus on production code (ignore test files) and follow these steps:
1. Identify similar existing features or components that this new feature should integrate with
2. Find relevant class definitions, interfaces, and API patterns used in the codebase
3. Locate related modules and services that the new feature will interact with
4. Include architectural patterns and code conventions used in similar implementations

Skip any test files

All aggregated context for the queries:
--- BEGIN AGGREGATED CONTEXT ---

--- END AGGREGATED CONTEXT ---

Analyze if the current context is sufficient to complete the user query by considering:
1. Do you understand the full scope and requirements of the user query?
2. Do you have access to all relevant code that needs to be examined or modified?
3. Are all critical dependencies and their interfaces visible?
4. Is there enough context about the system architecture and design patterns?
5. Do you have access to relevant documentation or tests if needed?

Only request additional context if essential information is missing. Ensure you're not requesting:
- Information already provided in previous queries
- Nice-to-have but non-essential details
- Implementation details that aren't relevant to the current task

If additional context is needed:
- Be specific about what you're looking for
- Consider both code and documentation that might be relevant

IMPORTANT:
- Try to avoid asking for the SAME or very similar information as previous queries, because these queries have already been asked and satisfied.

1. # Troubleshooting Guide
2. 
3. This guide describes how to troubleshoot common issues when using Gson.

8. ## <a id="class-cast-exception"></a> `ClassCastException` when using deserialized object
9. 
10. **Symptom:** `ClassCastException` is thrown when accessing an object deserialized by Gson
11. 
12. **Reason:** Your code is most likely not type-safe
13. 
14. **Solution:** Make sure your code adheres to the following:
15. 
16. - Avoid raw types: Instead of calling `fromJson(..., List.class)`, create for example a `TypeToken<List<MyClass>>`.
17.   See the [user guide](UserGuide.md#collections-examples) for more information.
18. - When using `TypeToken` prefer the `Gson.fromJson` overloads with `TypeToken` parameter such as [`fromJson(Reader, TypeToken)`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/Gson.html#fromJson(java.io.Reader,com.google.gson.reflect.TypeToken)).
19.   The overloads with `Type` parameter do not provide any type-safety guarantees.
20. - When using `TypeToken` make sure you don't capture a type variable. For example avoid something like `new TypeToken<List<T>>()` (where `T` is a type variable). Due to Java type erasure the actual type of `T` is not available at runtime. Refactor your code to pass around `TypeToken` instances or use [`TypeToken.getParameterized(...)`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/reflect/TypeToken.html#getParameterized(java.lang.reflect.Type,java.lang.reflect.Type...)), for example `TypeToken.getParameterized(List.class, elementClass)`.
21. 
22. ## <a id="reflection-inaccessible"></a> `InaccessibleObjectException`: 'module ... does not "opens ..." to unnamed module'
23. 
24. **Symptom:** An exception with a message in the form 'module ... does not "opens ..." to unnamed module' is thrown
25. 
26. **Reason:** You use Gson by accident to access internal fields of third-party classes
27. 
28. **Solution:** Write custom Gson [`TypeAdapter`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html) implementations for the affected classes or change the type of your data. If this occurs for a field in one of your classes which you did not actually want to serialize or deserialize in the first place, you can exclude that field, see the [user guide](UserGuide.md#excluding-fields-from-serialization-and-deserialization).
29. 
30. **Explanation:**
31. 
32. When no built-in adapter for a type exists and no custom adapter has been registered, Gson falls back to using reflection to access the fields of a class (including `private` ones). Most likely you are seeing this error because you (by accident) rely on the reflection-based adapter for third-party classes. That should be avoided because you make yourself dependent on the implementation details of these classes which could change at any point. For the JDK it is also not possible anymore to access internal fields using reflection starting with JDK 17, see [JEP 403](https://openjdk.org/jeps/403).
33. 
34. If you want to prevent using reflection on third-party classes in the future you can write your own [`ReflectionAccessFilter`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/ReflectionAccessFilter.html) or use one of the predefined ones, such as `ReflectionAccessFilter.BLOCK_ALL_PLATFORM`.

37. 
38. **Symptom:** An exception with a message in the form 'module ... does not "opens ..." to module com.google.gson' is thrown
39. 
40. **Reason:**
41. 
42. - If the reported package is your own package then you have not configured the module declaration of your project to allow Gson to use reflection on your classes.
43. - If the reported package is from a third party library or the JDK see [this troubleshooting point](#inaccessibleobjectexception-module--does-not-opens--to-unnamed-module).
44. 
45. **Solution:** Make sure the `module-info.java` file of your project allows Gson to use reflection on your classes, for example:
46. 
47. ```java
48. module mymodule {
49.     requires com.google.gson;
50. 
51.     opens mypackage to com.google.gson;
52. }
53. ```
54. 
55. Or in case this occurs for a field in one of your classes which you did not actually want to serialize or deserialize in the first place, you can exclude that field, see the [user guide](UserGuide.md#excluding-fields-from-serialization-and-deserialization).
56. 
57. ## <a id="android-app-random-names"></a> Android app not working in Release mode; random property names
58. 
59. **Symptom:** Your Android app is working fine in Debug mode but fails in Release mode and the JSON properties have seemingly random names such as `a`, `b`, ...
60. 
61. **Reason:** You probably have not configured ProGuard / R8 correctly
62. 
63. **Solution:** Make sure you have configured ProGuard / R8 correctly to preserve the names of your fields. See the [Android example](examples/android-proguard-example/README.md) for more information.
64. 
65. ## <a id="android-app-broken-after-app-update"></a> Android app unable to parse JSON after app update
66. 
67. **Symptom:** You released a new version of your Android app and it fails to parse JSON data created by the previous version of your app
68. 
69. **Reason:** You probably have not configured ProGuard / R8 correctly; probably the fields names are being obfuscated and their naming changed between the versions of your app
70. 
71. **Solution:** Make sure you have configured ProGuard / R8 correctly to preserve the names of your fields. See the [Android example](examples/android-proguard-example/README.md) for more information.
72. 
73. If you want to preserve backward compatibility for you app you can use [`@SerializedName`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/annotations/SerializedName.html) on the fields to specify the obfuscated name as alternate, for example: `@SerializedName(value = "myprop", alternate = "a")`
74. 
75. Normally ProGuard and R8 produce a mapping file, this makes it easier to find out the obfuscated field names instead of having to find them out through trial and error or other means. See the [Android Studio user guide](https://developer.android.com/studio/build/shrink-code.html#retracing) for more information.
76. 
77. ## <a id="default-field-values-missing"></a> Default field values not present after deserialization
78. 
79. **Symptom:** You have assign default values to fields but after deserialization the fields have their standard value (such as `null` or `0`)
80. 
81. **Reason:** Gson cannot invoke the constructor of your class and falls back to JDK `Unsafe` (or similar means)
82. 
83. **Solution:** Make sure that the class:
84. 
85. - is `static` (explicitly or implicitly when it is a top-level class)
86. - has a no-args constructor
87. 
88. Otherwise Gson will by default try to use JDK `Unsafe` or similar means to create an instance of your class without invoking the constructor and without running any initializers. You can also disable that behavior through [`GsonBuilder.disableJdkUnsafe()`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.html#disableJdkUnsafe()) to notice such issues early on.
89. 
90. ## <a id="anonymous-local-null"></a> `null` values for anonymous and local classes
91. 
92. **Symptom:** Objects of a class are always serialized as JSON `null` / always deserialized as Java `null`
93. 
94. **Reason:** The class you are serializing or deserializing is an anonymous or a local class (or you have specified a custom `ExclusionStrategy`)
95. 
96. **Solution:** Convert the class to a `static` nested class. If the class is already `static` make sure you have not specified a Gson `ExclusionStrategy` which might exclude the class.
97. 
98. Notes:
99. 
100. - "double brace-initialization" also creates anonymous classes
101. - Local record classes (feature added in Java 16) are supported by Gson and are not affected by this
102. 
103. ## <a id="map-key-wrong-json"></a> Map keys having unexpected format in JSON
104. 
105. **Symptom:** JSON output for `Map` keys is unexpected / cannot be deserialized again
106. 
107. **Reason:** The `Map` key type is 'complex' and you have not configured the `GsonBuilder` properly
108. 
109. **Solution:** Use [`GsonBuilder.enableComplexMapKeySerialization()`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.html#enableComplexMapKeySerialization()). See also the [user guide](UserGuide.md#maps-examples) for more information.
110. 
111. ## <a id="malformed-json"></a> Parsing JSON fails with `MalformedJsonException`
112. 
113. **Symptom:** JSON parsing fails with `MalformedJsonException`
114. 
115. **Reason:** The JSON data is actually malformed
116. 
117. **Solution:** During debugging, log the JSON data right before calling Gson methods or set a breakpoint to inspect the data and make sure it has the expected format. Sometimes APIs might return HTML error pages (instead of JSON data) when reaching rate limits or when other errors occur. Also read the location information of the `MalformedJsonException` exception message, it indicates where exactly in the document the malformed data was detected, including the [JSONPath](https://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/).
118. 
119. For example, let's assume you want to deserialize the following JSON data:
120. 
121. ```json
122. {
123.   "languages": [
124.     "English",
125.     "French",
126.   ]
127. }
128. ```
129. 
130. This will fail with an exception similar to this one: `MalformedJsonException: Use JsonReader.setLenient(true) to accept malformed JSON at line 5 column 4 path $.languages[2]`  
131. The problem here is the trailing comma (`,`) after `"French"`, trailing commas are not allowed by the JSON specification. The location information "line 5 column 4" points to the `]` in the JSON data (with some slight inaccuracies) because Gson expected another value after `,` instead of the closing `]`. The JSONPath `$.languages[2]` in the exception message also points there: `$.` refers to the root object, `languages` refers to its member of that name and `[2]` refers to the (missing) third value in the JSON array value of that member (numbering starts at 0, so it is `[2]` instead of `[3]`).  
132. The proper solution here is to fix the malformed JSON data.
133. 
134. To spot syntax errors in the JSON data easily you can open it in an editor with support for JSON, for example Visual Studio Code. It will highlight within the JSON data the error location and show why the JSON data is considered invalid.
135. 
136. ## <a id="number-parsed-as-double"></a> Integral JSON number is parsed as `double`
137. 
138. **Symptom:** JSON data contains an integral number such as `45` but Gson returns it as `double`
139. 
140. **Reason:** When parsing a JSON number as `Object`, Gson will by default create always return a `double`
141. 
142. **Solution:** Use [`GsonBuilder.setObjectToNumberStrategy`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.html#setObjectToNumberStrategy(com.google.gson.ToNumberStrategy)) to specify what type of number should be returned
143. 
144. ## <a id="default-lenient"></a> Malformed JSON not rejected
145. 
146. **Symptom:** Gson parses malformed JSON without throwing any exceptions
147. 
148. **Reason:** Due to legacy reasons Gson performs parsing by default in lenient mode
149. 
150. **Solution:** See [`Gson` class documentation](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/Gson.html#default-lenient) section "Lenient JSON handling"
151. 
152. Note: Even in non-lenient mode Gson deviates slightly from the JSON specification, see [`JsonReader.setLenient`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/stream/JsonReader.html#setLenient(boolean)) for more details.
153. 
154. ## <a id="unexpected-json-structure"></a> `IllegalStateException`: "Expected ... but was ..."
155. 
156. **Symptom:** An `IllegalStateException` with a message in the form "Expected ... but was ..." is thrown
157. 
158. **Reason:** The JSON data does not have the correct format
159. 
160. **Solution:** Make sure that your classes correctly model the JSON data. Also during debugging log the JSON data right before calling Gson methods or set a breakpoint to inspect the data and make sure it has the expected format. Read the location information of the exception message, it indicates where exactly in the document the error occurred, including the [JSONPath](https://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/).
161. 
162. For example, let's assume you have the following Java class:
163. 
164. ```java
165. class WebPage {
166.     String languages;
167. }
168. ```
169. 
170. And you want to deserialize the following JSON data:
171. 
172. ```json
173. {
174.   "languages": ["English", "French"]
175. }
176. ```
177. 
178. This will fail with an exception similar to this one: `IllegalStateException: Expected a string but was BEGIN_ARRAY at line 2 column 17 path $.languages`  
179. This means Gson expected a JSON string value but found the beginning of a JSON array (`[`). The location information "line 2 column 17" points to the `[` in the JSON data (with some slight inaccuracies), so does the JSONPath `$.languages` in the exception message. It refers to the `languages` member of the root object (`$.`).  
180. The solution here is to change in the `WebPage` class the field `String languages` to `List<String> languages`.
181. 
182. ## <a id="adapter-not-null-safe"></a> `IllegalStateException`: "Expected ... but was NULL"
183. 
184. **Symptom:** An `IllegalStateException` with a message in the form "Expected ... but was NULL" is thrown
185. 
186. **Reason:**
187. 
188. - A built-in adapter does not support JSON null values
189. - You have written a custom `TypeAdapter` which does not properly handle JSON null values
190. 
191. **Solution:** If this occurs for a custom adapter you wrote, add code similar to the following at the beginning of its `read` method:
192. 
193. ```java
194. @Override
195. public MyClass read(JsonReader in) throws IOException {
196.     if (in.peek() == JsonToken.NULL) {
197.         in.nextNull();
198.         return null;
199.     }
200. 
201.     ...
202. }
203. ```
204. 
205. Alternatively you can call [`nullSafe()`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html#nullSafe()) on the adapter instance you created.
206. 
207. ## <a id="serialize-nulls"></a> Properties missing in JSON
208. 
209. **Symptom:** Properties are missing in the JSON output
210. 
211. **Reason:** Gson by default omits JSON null from the output (or: ProGuard / R8 is not configured correctly and removed unused fields)
212. 
213. **Solution:** Use [`GsonBuilder.serializeNulls()`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.html#serializeNulls())
214. 
215. Note: Gson does not support anonymous and local classes and will serialize them as JSON null, see the [related troubleshooting point](#null-values-for-anonymous-and-local-classes).
216. 
217. ## <a id="android-internal-fields"></a> JSON output changes for newer Android versions
218. 
219. **Symptom:** The JSON output differs when running on newer Android versions
220. 
221. **Reason:** You use Gson by accident to access internal fields of Android classes
222. 
223. **Solution:** Write custom Gson [`TypeAdapter`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html) implementations for the affected classes or change the type of your data
224. 
225. **Explanation:**
226. 
227. When no built-in adapter for a type exists and no custom adapter has been registered, Gson falls back to using reflection to access the fields of a class (including `private` ones). Most likely you are experiencing this issue because you (by accident) rely on the reflection-based adapter for Android classes. That should be avoided because you make yourself dependent on the implementation details of these classes which could change at any point.
228. 
229. If you want to prevent using reflection on third-party classes in the future you can write your own [`ReflectionAccessFilter`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/ReflectionAccessFilter.html) or use one of the predefined ones, such as `ReflectionAccessFilter.BLOCK_ALL_PLATFORM`.
230. 
231. ## <a id="json-static-fields"></a> JSON output contains values of `static` fields
232. 
233. **Symptom:** The JSON output contains values of `static` fields
234. 
235. **Reason:** You used `GsonBuilder.excludeFieldsWithModifiers` to overwrite the default excluded modifiers
236. 
237. **Solution:** When calling `GsonBuilder.excludeFieldsWithModifiers` you overwrite the default excluded modifiers. Therefore, you have to explicitly exclude `static` fields if desired. This can be done by adding `Modifier.STATIC` as additional argument.
238. 
239. ## <a id="no-such-method-error"></a> `NoSuchMethodError` when calling Gson methods
240. 
241. **Symptom:** A `java.lang.NoSuchMethodError` is thrown when trying to call certain Gson methods
242. 
243. **Reason:**
244. 
245. - You have multiple versions of Gson on your classpath
246. - Or, the Gson version you compiled against is different from the one on your classpath
247. - Or, you are using a code shrinking tool such as ProGuard or R8 which removed methods from Gson
248. 
249. **Solution:** First disable any code shrinking tools such as ProGuard or R8 and check if the issue persists. If not, you have to tweak the configuration of that tool to not modify Gson classes. Otherwise verify that the Gson JAR on your classpath is the same you are compiling against, and that there is only one Gson JAR on your classpath. See [this Stack Overflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/q/227486) to find out where a class is loaded from. For example, for debugging you could include the following code:
250. 
251. ```java
252. System.out.println(Gson.class.getProtectionDomain().getCodeSource().getLocation());
253. ```
254. 
255. If that fails with a `NullPointerException` you have to try one of the other ways to find out where a class is loaded from.
256. 
257. ## <a id="duplicate-fields"></a> `IllegalArgumentException`: 'Class ... declares multiple JSON fields named '...''
258. 
259. **Symptom:** An exception with the message 'Class ... declares multiple JSON fields named '...'' is thrown
260. 
261. **Reason:**
262. 
263. - The name you have specified with a [`@SerializedName`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/annotations/SerializedName.html) annotation for a field collides with the name of another field
264. - The [`FieldNamingStrategy`](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/FieldNamingStrategy.html) you have specified produces conflicting field names
265. - A field of your class has the same name as the field of a superclass
266. 
267. Gson prevents multiple fields with the same name because during deserialization it would be ambiguous for which field the JSON data should be deserialized. For serialization it would cause the same field to appear multiple times in JSON. While the JSON specification permits this, it is likely that the application parsing the JSON data will not handle it correctly.
268. 
269. **Solution:** First identify the fields with conflicting names based on the exception message. Then decide if you want to rename one of them using the [`@SerializedName`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/annotations/SerializedName.html) annotation, or if you want to [exclude](UserGuide.md#excluding-fields-from-serialization-and-deserialization) one of them. When excluding one of the fields you have to include it for both serialization and deserialization (even if your application only performs one of these actions) because the duplicate field check cannot differentiate between these actions.
270. 
271. ## <a id="java-lang-class-unsupported"></a> `UnsupportedOperationException` when serializing or deserializing `java.lang.Class`
272. 
273. **Symptom:** An `UnsupportedOperationException` is thrown when trying to serialize or deserialize `java.lang.Class`
274. 
275. **Reason:** Gson intentionally does not permit serializing and deserializing `java.lang.Class` for security reasons. Otherwise a malicious user could make your application load an arbitrary class from the classpath and, depending on what your application does with the `Class`, in the worst case perform a remote code execution attack.
276. 
277. **Solution:** First check if you really need to serialize or deserialize a `Class`. Often it is possible to use string aliases and then map them to the known `Class`; you could write a custom [`TypeAdapter`](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html) to do this. If the `Class` values are not known in advance, try to introduce a common base class or interface for all these classes and then verify that the deserialized class is a subclass. For example assuming the base class is called `MyBaseClass`, your custom `TypeAdapter` should load the class like this:
278. 
279. ```java
280. Class.forName(jsonString, false, getClass().getClassLoader()).asSubclass(MyBaseClass.class)
281. ```
282. 
283. This will not initialize arbitrary classes, and it will throw a `ClassCastException` if the loaded class is not the same as or a subclass of `MyBaseClass`.
284. 
285. ## <a id="type-token-raw"></a> `IllegalStateException`: 'TypeToken must be created with a type argument' <br> `RuntimeException`: 'Missing type parameter'
286. 
287. **Symptom:** An `IllegalStateException` with the message 'TypeToken must be created with a type argument' is thrown.  
288. For older Gson versions a `RuntimeException` with message 'Missing type parameter' is thrown.
289. 
290. **Reason:**
291. 
292. - You created a `TypeToken` without type argument, for example `new TypeToken() {}` (note the missing `<...>`). You always have to provide the type argument, for example like this: `new TypeToken<List<String>>() {}`. Normally the compiler will also emit a 'raw types' warning when you forget the `<...>`.
293. - You are using a code shrinking tool such as ProGuard or R8 (Android app builds normally have this enabled by default) but have not configured it correctly for usage with Gson.
294. 
295. **Solution:** When you are using a code shrinking tool such as ProGuard or R8 you have to adjust your configuration to include the following rules:
296. 
297. ```
298. # Keep generic signatures; needed for correct type resolution
299. -keepattributes Signature
300. 
301. # Keep class TypeToken (respectively its generic signature)
302. -keep class com.google.gson.reflect.TypeToken { *; }
303. 
304. # Keep any (anonymous) classes extending TypeToken
305. -keep class * extends com.google.gson.reflect.TypeToken
306. ```
307. 
308. See also the [Android example](examples/android-proguard-example/README.md) for more information.
309. 
310. Note: For newer Gson versions these rules might be applied automatically; make sure you are using the latest Gson version and the latest version of the code shrinking tool.
311. 
312. ## <a id="r8-abstract-class"></a> `JsonIOException`: 'Abstract classes can't be instantiated!' (R8)
313. 
314. **Symptom:** A `JsonIOException` with the message 'Abstract classes can't be instantiated!' is thrown; the class mentioned in the exception message is not actually `abstract` in your source code, and you are using the code shrinking tool R8 (Android app builds normally have this configured by default).
315. 
316. **Reason:** The code shrinking tool R8 performs optimizations where it removes the no-args constructor from a class and makes the class `abstract`. Due to this Gson cannot create an instance of the class.
317. 
318. **Solution:** Make sure the class has a no-args constructor, then adjust your R8 configuration file to keep the constructor of the class. For example:
319. 
320. ```
321. # Keep the no-args constructor of the deserialized class
322. -keepclassmembers class com.example.MyClass {
323.   <init>();
324. }
325. ```
326. 
327. For Android you can add this rule to the `proguard-rules.pro` file, see also the [Android documentation](https://developer.android.com/build/shrink-code#keep-code). In case the class name in the exception message is obfuscated, see the Android documentation about [retracing](https://developer.android.com/build/shrink-code#retracing).
328. 
329. Note: If the class which you are trying to deserialize is actually abstract, then this exception is probably unrelated to R8 and you will have to implement a custom [`InstanceCreator`](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/InstanceCreator.html) or [`TypeAdapter`](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html) which creates an instance of a non-abstract subclass of the class.

Issue title:
Improve default ProGuard / R8 rules and Troubleshooting Guide

Issue description: 
# Problem solved by the feature
Improve the default ProGuard / R8 rules in `META-INF/proguard/gson.pro` added by #2397, and the Troubleshooting Guide.

# Feature description
I was testing the new default rules with an Android app and Kotlin classes, and there might be the following areas to improve.

### Troubleshooting Guide: `JsonIOException`: 'Abstract classes can't be instantiated!' (R8)

The Troubleshooting Guide currently suggests the following:
```
# Keep the no-args constructor of the deserialized class
-keepclassmembers class com.example.MyClass {
  <init>();
}
```

This means only the no-args constructor is kept, but not any other constructors. However, especially for Kotlin I assume it is common that classes don't have a no-args constructor because you might declare properties and the primary constructor at once, e.g. `class MyClass(val s: String)` (see [Kotlin documentation](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/classes.html#constructors)). Not sure though if using that is a good idea in combination with Gson because it then requires JDK Unsafe to create instances, but that is a different topic.

So there are two questions:
- Should the Troubleshooting Guide rather recommend `<init>(...);` (all constructors), so that the users don't experience issues with R8 anymore (but implicitly depend on JDK Unsafe; using `GsonBuilder.disableJdkUnsafe()` would cause Gson to fail with a different exception)
- Should the Troubleshooting Guide recommend `-keep` instead of `-keepclassmembers`. In case the `<init>` rule for the class properly matches a constructor it might not matter. But in case `<init>();` is used, but a no-args constructor does not exist, then `-keep` seems to at least have the side-effect that R8 does not make the class abstract (and then using JDK Unsafe an instance can be created).

### Troubleshooting Guide: Recommend `@Keep` for Android
Instead of configuring ProGuard / R8 rules, it might be easier for Android developers to use `@Keep` on the corresponding class or constructor, see https://developer.android.com/studio/write/annotations#keep

### Preventing R8 from making classes abstract / removing no-args constructor

It would be good if we could adjust the default rules to avoid the "Abstract classes can't be instantiated!" exception (for most cases) in the first place.

There is probably no general way to detect if a class might be used with Gson, but the most reliable variant might be to keep the constructor if any of the Gson annotations is used by a class.

This can probably be achieved with an [`-if` rule](https://www.guardsquare.com/manual/configuration/usage#if) (see also [answers to this Stack Overflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/q/63162818)). For example:
```
# If class has fields with `@SerializedName` annotation keep its constructors
-if class * {
  @com.google.gson.annotations.SerializedName <fields>;
}
-keep class <1> {
  <init>(...);
}
```
(duplicated for all Gson annotations)

But it looks like this is not enough, maybe because there is no `-keep` (or `-keepclasseswithmembers`) rule for the class in the first place so `-if` somehow has no effect? You additionally need the following (duplicated for all Gson annotations probably):
```
-keepclasseswithmembers class * {
  @com.google.gson.annotations.SerializedName <fields>;
}
```
Only then the class is not made abstract and the constructor is properly kept...

(As side note: Having only the `-keepclasseswithmembers ... { @SerializedName }` above, but not the `-if ... -keep` seems to prevent R8 from making the class abstract, but still removes all constructors, so users would be dependent on JDK Unsafe then.)

Or similar to https://github.com/google/gson/issues/2379#issuecomment-1564517629 maybe the following would work as well:
```
-keepclasseswithmembers class * {
  <init>(...);
  @com.google.gson.annotations.SerializedName <fields>;
}
```
There is however probably no need for the `-if` rule shown in the original comment, unless that has some special effect, see https://github.com/google/gson/pull/2397#issuecomment-1575236086.

### R8 makes class abstract but still keeps constructors

It also looks like the Android app build creates (for some reason) additional constructors / keeps constructors even when the class is made abstract. Due to this, the Troubleshooting Guide URLs are unfortunately not included in the exception messages (they are only added at the moment when there are no constructors).
Not really sure why these constructors exist in the first place and are kept even when the class is made abstract. In the R8 integration test of Gson this behavior was not seen.

Maybe we should remove the `getDeclaredConstructors().length == 0` check if the class is abstract and always refer to the Troubleshooting Guide. The guide would have to be adjusted then though to also properly cover the case where the class was indeed abstract in the source code.

8. ## <a id="class-cast-exception"></a> `ClassCastException` when using deserialized object
9. 
10. **Symptom:** `ClassCastException` is thrown when accessing an object deserialized by Gson
11. 
12. **Reason:** Your code is most likely not type-safe
13. 
14. **Solution:** Make sure your code adheres to the following:
15. 
16. - Avoid raw types: Instead of calling `fromJson(..., List.class)`, create for example a `TypeToken<List<MyClass>>`.
17.   See the [user guide](UserGuide.md#collections-examples) for more information.
18. - When using `TypeToken` prefer the `Gson.fromJson` overloads with `TypeToken` parameter such as [`fromJson(Reader, TypeToken)`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/Gson.html#fromJson(java.io.Reader,com.google.gson.reflect.TypeToken)).
19.   The overloads with `Type` parameter do not provide any type-safety guarantees.
20. - When using `TypeToken` make sure you don't capture a type variable. For example avoid something like `new TypeToken<List<T>>()` (where `T` is a type variable). Due to Java type erasure the actual type of `T` is not available at runtime. Refactor your code to pass around `TypeToken` instances or use [`TypeToken.getParameterized(...)`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/reflect/TypeToken.html#getParameterized(java.lang.reflect.Type,java.lang.reflect.Type...)), for example `TypeToken.getParameterized(List.class, elementClass)`.
21. 
22. ## <a id="reflection-inaccessible"></a> `InaccessibleObjectException`: 'module ... does not "opens ..." to unnamed module'
23. 
24. **Symptom:** An exception with a message in the form 'module ... does not "opens ..." to unnamed module' is thrown
25. 
26. **Reason:** You use Gson by accident to access internal fields of third-party classes
27. 
28. **Solution:** Write custom Gson [`TypeAdapter`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html) implementations for the affected classes or change the type of your data. If this occurs for a field in one of your classes which you did not actually want to serialize or deserialize in the first place, you can exclude that field, see the [user guide](UserGuide.md#excluding-fields-from-serialization-and-deserialization).
29. 
30. **Explanation:**
31. 
32. When no built-in adapter for a type exists and no custom adapter has been registered, Gson falls back to using reflection to access the fields of a class (including `private` ones). Most likely you are seeing this error because you (by accident) rely on the reflection-based adapter for third-party classes. That should be avoided because you make yourself dependent on the implementation details of these classes which could change at any point. For the JDK it is also not possible anymore to access internal fields using reflection starting with JDK 17, see [JEP 403](https://openjdk.org/jeps/403).
33. 
34. If you want to prevent using reflection on third-party classes in the future you can write your own [`ReflectionAccessFilter`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/ReflectionAccessFilter.html) or use one of the predefined ones, such as `ReflectionAccessFilter.BLOCK_ALL_PLATFORM`.
35. 
36. ## <a id="reflection-inaccessible-to-module-gson"></a> `InaccessibleObjectException`: 'module ... does not "opens ..." to module com.google.gson'
37. 
38. **Symptom:** An exception with a message in the form 'module ... does not "opens ..." to module com.google.gson' is thrown
39. 
40. **Reason:**
41. 
42. - If the reported package is your own package then you have not configured the module declaration of your project to allow Gson to use reflection on your classes.
43. - If the reported package is from a third party library or the JDK see [this troubleshooting point](#inaccessibleobjectexception-module--does-not-opens--to-unnamed-module).
44. 
45. **Solution:** Make sure the `module-info.java` file of your project allows Gson to use reflection on your classes, for example:
46. 
47. ```java
48. module mymodule {
49.     requires com.google.gson;
50. 
51.     opens mypackage to com.google.gson;
52. }
53. ```
54. 
55. Or in case this occurs for a field in one of your classes which you did not actually want to serialize or deserialize in the first place, you can exclude that field, see the [user guide](UserGuide.md#excluding-fields-from-serialization-and-deserialization).
56. 
57. ## <a id="android-app-random-names"></a> Android app not working in Release mode; random property names
58. 
59. **Symptom:** Your Android app is working fine in Debug mode but fails in Release mode and the JSON properties have seemingly random names such as `a`, `b`, ...
60. 
61. **Reason:** You probably have not configured ProGuard / R8 correctly
62. 
63. **Solution:** Make sure you have configured ProGuard / R8 correctly to preserve the names of your fields. See the [Android example](examples/android-proguard-example/README.md) for more information.
64. 
65. ## <a id="android-app-broken-after-app-update"></a> Android app unable to parse JSON after app update
66. 
67. **Symptom:** You released a new version of your Android app and it fails to parse JSON data created by the previous version of your app
68. 
69. **Reason:** You probably have not configured ProGuard / R8 correctly; probably the fields names are being obfuscated and their naming changed between the versions of your app
70. 
71. **Solution:** Make sure you have configured ProGuard / R8 correctly to preserve the names of your fields. See the [Android example](examples/android-proguard-example/README.md) for more information.
72. 
73. If you want to preserve backward compatibility for you app you can use [`@SerializedName`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/annotations/SerializedName.html) on the fields to specify the obfuscated name as alternate, for example: `@SerializedName(value = "myprop", alternate = "a")`
74. 
75. Normally ProGuard and R8 produce a mapping file, this makes it easier to find out the obfuscated field names instead of having to find them out through trial and error or other means. See the [Android Studio user guide](https://developer.android.com/studio/build/shrink-code.html#retracing) for more information.
76. 
77. ## <a id="default-field-values-missing"></a> Default field values not present after deserialization
78. 
79. **Symptom:** You have assign default values to fields but after deserialization the fields have their standard value (such as `null` or `0`)
80. 
81. **Reason:** Gson cannot invoke the constructor of your class and falls back to JDK `Unsafe` (or similar means)
82. 
83. **Solution:** Make sure that the class:
84. 
85. - is `static` (explicitly or implicitly when it is a top-level class)
86. - has a no-args constructor
87. 
88. Otherwise Gson will by default try to use JDK `Unsafe` or similar means to create an instance of your class without invoking the constructor and without running any initializers. You can also disable that behavior through [`GsonBuilder.disableJdkUnsafe()`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.html#disableJdkUnsafe()) to notice such issues early on.
89. 
90. ## <a id="anonymous-local-null"></a> `null` values for anonymous and local classes
91. 
92. **Symptom:** Objects of a class are always serialized as JSON `null` / always deserialized as Java `null`
93. 
94. **Reason:** The class you are serializing or deserializing is an anonymous or a local class (or you have specified a custom `ExclusionStrategy`)
95. 
96. **Solution:** Convert the class to a `static` nested class. If the class is already `static` make sure you have not specified a Gson `ExclusionStrategy` which might exclude the class.
97. 
98. Notes:
99. 
100. - "double brace-initialization" also creates anonymous classes
101. - Local record classes (feature added in Java 16) are supported by Gson and are not affected by this
102. 
103. ## <a id="map-key-wrong-json"></a> Map keys having unexpected format in JSON
104. 
105. **Symptom:** JSON output for `Map` keys is unexpected / cannot be deserialized again
106. 
107. **Reason:** The `Map` key type is 'complex' and you have not configured the `GsonBuilder` properly
108. 
109. **Solution:** Use [`GsonBuilder.enableComplexMapKeySerialization()`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.html#enableComplexMapKeySerialization()). See also the [user guide](UserGuide.md#maps-examples) for more information.
110. 
111. ## <a id="malformed-json"></a> Parsing JSON fails with `MalformedJsonException`
112. 
113. **Symptom:** JSON parsing fails with `MalformedJsonException`
114. 
115. **Reason:** The JSON data is actually malformed
116. 
117. **Solution:** During debugging, log the JSON data right before calling Gson methods or set a breakpoint to inspect the data and make sure it has the expected format. Sometimes APIs might return HTML error pages (instead of JSON data) when reaching rate limits or when other errors occur. Also read the location information of the `MalformedJsonException` exception message, it indicates where exactly in the document the malformed data was detected, including the [JSONPath](https://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/).
118. 
119. For example, let's assume you want to deserialize the following JSON data:
120. 
121. ```json
122. {
123.   "languages": [
124.     "English",
125.     "French",
126.   ]
127. }
128. ```
129. 
130. This will fail with an exception similar to this one: `MalformedJsonException: Use JsonReader.setLenient(true) to accept malformed JSON at line 5 column 4 path $.languages[2]`  
131. The problem here is the trailing comma (`,`) after `"French"`, trailing commas are not allowed by the JSON specification. The location information "line 5 column 4" points to the `]` in the JSON data (with some slight inaccuracies) because Gson expected another value after `,` instead of the closing `]`. The JSONPath `$.languages[2]` in the exception message also points there: `$.` refers to the root object, `languages` refers to its member of that name and `[2]` refers to the (missing) third value in the JSON array value of that member (numbering starts at 0, so it is `[2]` instead of `[3]`).  
132. The proper solution here is to fix the malformed JSON data.
133. 
134. To spot syntax errors in the JSON data easily you can open it in an editor with support for JSON, for example Visual Studio Code. It will highlight within the JSON data the error location and show why the JSON data is considered invalid.
135. 
136. ## <a id="number-parsed-as-double"></a> Integral JSON number is parsed as `double`
137. 
138. **Symptom:** JSON data contains an integral number such as `45` but Gson returns it as `double`
139. 
140. **Reason:** When parsing a JSON number as `Object`, Gson will by default create always return a `double`
141. 
142. **Solution:** Use [`GsonBuilder.setObjectToNumberStrategy`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.html#setObjectToNumberStrategy(com.google.gson.ToNumberStrategy)) to specify what type of number should be returned
143. 
144. ## <a id="default-lenient"></a> Malformed JSON not rejected
145. 
146. **Symptom:** Gson parses malformed JSON without throwing any exceptions
147. 
148. **Reason:** Due to legacy reasons Gson performs parsing by default in lenient mode
149. 
150. **Solution:** See [`Gson` class documentation](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/Gson.html#default-lenient) section "Lenient JSON handling"
151. 
152. Note: Even in non-lenient mode Gson deviates slightly from the JSON specification, see [`JsonReader.setLenient`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/stream/JsonReader.html#setLenient(boolean)) for more details.
153. 
154. ## <a id="unexpected-json-structure"></a> `IllegalStateException`: "Expected ... but was ..."
155. 
156. **Symptom:** An `IllegalStateException` with a message in the form "Expected ... but was ..." is thrown
157. 
158. **Reason:** The JSON data does not have the correct format
159. 
160. **Solution:** Make sure that your classes correctly model the JSON data. Also during debugging log the JSON data right before calling Gson methods or set a breakpoint to inspect the data and make sure it has the expected format. Read the location information of the exception message, it indicates where exactly in the document the error occurred, including the [JSONPath](https://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/).
161. 
162. For example, let's assume you have the following Java class:
163. 
164. ```java
165. class WebPage {
166.     String languages;
167. }
168. ```
169. 
170. And you want to deserialize the following JSON data:
171. 
172. ```json
173. {
174.   "languages": ["English", "French"]
175. }
176. ```
177. 
178. This will fail with an exception similar to this one: `IllegalStateException: Expected a string but was BEGIN_ARRAY at line 2 column 17 path $.languages`  
179. This means Gson expected a JSON string value but found the beginning of a JSON array (`[`). The location information "line 2 column 17" points to the `[` in the JSON data (with some slight inaccuracies), so does the JSONPath `$.languages` in the exception message. It refers to the `languages` member of the root object (`$.`).  
180. The solution here is to change in the `WebPage` class the field `String languages` to `List<String> languages`.
181. 
182. ## <a id="adapter-not-null-safe"></a> `IllegalStateException`: "Expected ... but was NULL"
183. 
184. **Symptom:** An `IllegalStateException` with a message in the form "Expected ... but was NULL" is thrown
185. 
186. **Reason:**
187. 
188. - A built-in adapter does not support JSON null values
189. - You have written a custom `TypeAdapter` which does not properly handle JSON null values
190. 
191. **Solution:** If this occurs for a custom adapter you wrote, add code similar to the following at the beginning of its `read` method:
192. 
193. ```java
194. @Override
195. public MyClass read(JsonReader in) throws IOException {
196.     if (in.peek() == JsonToken.NULL) {
197.         in.nextNull();
198.         return null;
199.     }
200. 
201.     ...
202. }
203. ```
204. 
205. Alternatively you can call [`nullSafe()`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html#nullSafe()) on the adapter instance you created.
206. 
207. ## <a id="serialize-nulls"></a> Properties missing in JSON
208. 
209. **Symptom:** Properties are missing in the JSON output
210. 
211. **Reason:** Gson by default omits JSON null from the output (or: ProGuard / R8 is not configured correctly and removed unused fields)
212. 
213. **Solution:** Use [`GsonBuilder.serializeNulls()`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.html#serializeNulls())
214. 
215. Note: Gson does not support anonymous and local classes and will serialize them as JSON null, see the [related troubleshooting point](#null-values-for-anonymous-and-local-classes).
216. 
217. ## <a id="android-internal-fields"></a> JSON output changes for newer Android versions
218. 
219. **Symptom:** The JSON output differs when running on newer Android versions
220. 
221. **Reason:** You use Gson by accident to access internal fields of Android classes
222. 
223. **Solution:** Write custom Gson [`TypeAdapter`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html) implementations for the affected classes or change the type of your data
224. 
225. **Explanation:**
226. 
227. When no built-in adapter for a type exists and no custom adapter has been registered, Gson falls back to using reflection to access the fields of a class (including `private` ones). Most likely you are experiencing this issue because you (by accident) rely on the reflection-based adapter for Android classes. That should be avoided because you make yourself dependent on the implementation details of these classes which could change at any point.
228. 
229. If you want to prevent using reflection on third-party classes in the future you can write your own [`ReflectionAccessFilter`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/ReflectionAccessFilter.html) or use one of the predefined ones, such as `ReflectionAccessFilter.BLOCK_ALL_PLATFORM`.
230. 
231. ## <a id="json-static-fields"></a> JSON output contains values of `static` fields
232. 
233. **Symptom:** The JSON output contains values of `static` fields
234. 
235. **Reason:** You used `GsonBuilder.excludeFieldsWithModifiers` to overwrite the default excluded modifiers
236. 
237. **Solution:** When calling `GsonBuilder.excludeFieldsWithModifiers` you overwrite the default excluded modifiers. Therefore, you have to explicitly exclude `static` fields if desired. This can be done by adding `Modifier.STATIC` as additional argument.
238. 
239. ## <a id="no-such-method-error"></a> `NoSuchMethodError` when calling Gson methods
240. 
241. **Symptom:** A `java.lang.NoSuchMethodError` is thrown when trying to call certain Gson methods
242. 
243. **Reason:**
244. 
245. - You have multiple versions of Gson on your classpath
246. - Or, the Gson version you compiled against is different from the one on your classpath
247. - Or, you are using a code shrinking tool such as ProGuard or R8 which removed methods from Gson
248. 
249. **Solution:** First disable any code shrinking tools such as ProGuard or R8 and check if the issue persists. If not, you have to tweak the configuration of that tool to not modify Gson classes. Otherwise verify that the Gson JAR on your classpath is the same you are compiling against, and that there is only one Gson JAR on your classpath. See [this Stack Overflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/q/227486) to find out where a class is loaded from. For example, for debugging you could include the following code:
250. 
251. ```java
252. System.out.println(Gson.class.getProtectionDomain().getCodeSource().getLocation());
253. ```
254. 
255. If that fails with a `NullPointerException` you have to try one of the other ways to find out where a class is loaded from.
256. 
257. ## <a id="duplicate-fields"></a> `IllegalArgumentException`: 'Class ... declares multiple JSON fields named '...''
258. 
259. **Symptom:** An exception with the message 'Class ... declares multiple JSON fields named '...'' is thrown
260. 
261. **Reason:**
262. 
263. - The name you have specified with a [`@SerializedName`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/annotations/SerializedName.html) annotation for a field collides with the name of another field
264. - The [`FieldNamingStrategy`](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/FieldNamingStrategy.html) you have specified produces conflicting field names
265. - A field of your class has the same name as the field of a superclass
266. 
267. Gson prevents multiple fields with the same name because during deserialization it would be ambiguous for which field the JSON data should be deserialized. For serialization it would cause the same field to appear multiple times in JSON. While the JSON specification permits this, it is likely that the application parsing the JSON data will not handle it correctly.
268. 
269. **Solution:** First identify the fields with conflicting names based on the exception message. Then decide if you want to rename one of them using the [`@SerializedName`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/annotations/SerializedName.html) annotation, or if you want to [exclude](UserGuide.md#excluding-fields-from-serialization-and-deserialization) one of them. When excluding one of the fields you have to include it for both serialization and deserialization (even if your application only performs one of these actions) because the duplicate field check cannot differentiate between these actions.
270. 
271. ## <a id="java-lang-class-unsupported"></a> `UnsupportedOperationException` when serializing or deserializing `java.lang.Class`
272. 
273. **Symptom:** An `UnsupportedOperationException` is thrown when trying to serialize or deserialize `java.lang.Class`
274. 
275. **Reason:** Gson intentionally does not permit serializing and deserializing `java.lang.Class` for security reasons. Otherwise a malicious user could make your application load an arbitrary class from the classpath and, depending on what your application does with the `Class`, in the worst case perform a remote code execution attack.
276. 
277. **Solution:** First check if you really need to serialize or deserialize a `Class`. Often it is possible to use string aliases and then map them to the known `Class`; you could write a custom [`TypeAdapter`](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html) to do this. If the `Class` values are not known in advance, try to introduce a common base class or interface for all these classes and then verify that the deserialized class is a subclass. For example assuming the base class is called `MyBaseClass`, your custom `TypeAdapter` should load the class like this:
278. 
279. ```java
280. Class.forName(jsonString, false, getClass().getClassLoader()).asSubclass(MyBaseClass.class)
281. ```
282. 
283. This will not initialize arbitrary classes, and it will throw a `ClassCastException` if the loaded class is not the same as or a subclass of `MyBaseClass`.
284. 
285. ## <a id="type-token-raw"></a> `IllegalStateException`: 'TypeToken must be created with a type argument' <br> `RuntimeException`: 'Missing type parameter'
286. 
287. **Symptom:** An `IllegalStateException` with the message 'TypeToken must be created with a type argument' is thrown.  
288. For older Gson versions a `RuntimeException` with message 'Missing type parameter' is thrown.
289. 
290. **Reason:**
291. 
292. - You created a `TypeToken` without type argument, for example `new TypeToken() {}` (note the missing `<...>`). You always have to provide the type argument, for example like this: `new TypeToken<List<String>>() {}`. Normally the compiler will also emit a 'raw types' warning when you forget the `<...>`.
293. - You are using a code shrinking tool such as ProGuard or R8 (Android app builds normally have this enabled by default) but have not configured it correctly for usage with Gson.
294. 
295. **Solution:** When you are using a code shrinking tool such as ProGuard or R8 you have to adjust your configuration to include the following rules:
296. 
297. ```
298. # Keep generic signatures; needed for correct type resolution
299. -keepattributes Signature
300. 
301. # Keep class TypeToken (respectively its generic signature)
302. -keep class com.google.gson.reflect.TypeToken { *; }
303. 
304. # Keep any (anonymous) classes extending TypeToken
305. -keep class * extends com.google.gson.reflect.TypeToken
306. ```
307. 
308. See also the [Android example](examples/android-proguard-example/README.md) for more information.
309. 
310. Note: For newer Gson versions these rules might be applied automatically; make sure you are using the latest Gson version and the latest version of the code shrinking tool.
311. 
312. ## <a id="r8-abstract-class"></a> `JsonIOException`: 'Abstract classes can't be instantiated!' (R8)
313. 
314. **Symptom:** A `JsonIOException` with the message 'Abstract classes can't be instantiated!' is thrown; the class mentioned in the exception message is not actually `abstract` in your source code, and you are using the code shrinking tool R8 (Android app builds normally have this configured by default).
315. 
316. **Reason:** The code shrinking tool R8 performs optimizations where it removes the no-args constructor from a class and makes the class `abstract`. Due to this Gson cannot create an instance of the class.
317. 
318. **Solution:** Make sure the class has a no-args constructor, then adjust your R8 configuration file to keep the constructor of the class. For example:
319. 
320. ```
321. # Keep the no-args constructor of the deserialized class
322. -keepclassmembers class com.example.MyClass {
323.   <init>();
324. }
325. ```
326. 
327. For Android you can add this rule to the `proguard-rules.pro` file, see also the [Android documentation](https://developer.android.com/build/shrink-code#keep-code). In case the class name in the exception message is obfuscated, see the Android documentation about [retracing](https://developer.android.com/build/shrink-code#retracing).
328. 
329. Note: If the class which you are trying to deserialize is actually abstract, then this exception is probably unrelated to R8 and you will have to implement a custom [`InstanceCreator`](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/InstanceCreator.html) or [`TypeAdapter`](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html) which creates an instance of a non-abstract subclass of the class.

--- END AGGREGATED CONTEXT ---

Analyze if the current context is sufficient to complete the user query by considering:
1. Do you understand the full scope and requirements of the user query?
2. Do you have access to all relevant code that needs to be examined or modified?
3. Are all critical dependencies and their interfaces visible?
4. Is there enough context about the system architecture and design patterns?
5. Do you have access to relevant documentation or tests if needed?

Only request additional context if essential information is missing. Ensure you're not requesting:
- Information already provided in previous queries
- Nice-to-have but non-essential details
- Implementation details that aren't relevant to the current task

If additional context is needed:
- Be specific about what you're looking for
- Consider both code and documentation that might be relevant

IMPORTANT:
- Try to avoid asking for the SAME or very similar information as previous queries, because these queries have already been asked and satisfied.

Issue title:
Improve default ProGuard / R8 rules and Troubleshooting Guide

Issue description: 
# Problem solved by the feature
Improve the default ProGuard / R8 rules in `META-INF/proguard/gson.pro` added by #2397, and the Troubleshooting Guide.

# Feature description
I was testing the new default rules with an Android app and Kotlin classes, and there might be the following areas to improve.

### Troubleshooting Guide: `JsonIOException`: 'Abstract classes can't be instantiated!' (R8)

The Troubleshooting Guide currently suggests the following:
```
# Keep the no-args constructor of the deserialized class
-keepclassmembers class com.example.MyClass {
  <init>();
}
```

This means only the no-args constructor is kept, but not any other constructors. However, especially for Kotlin I assume it is common that classes don't have a no-args constructor because you might declare properties and the primary constructor at once, e.g. `class MyClass(val s: String)` (see [Kotlin documentation](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/classes.html#constructors)). Not sure though if using that is a good idea in combination with Gson because it then requires JDK Unsafe to create instances, but that is a different topic.

So there are two questions:
- Should the Troubleshooting Guide rather recommend `<init>(...);` (all constructors), so that the users don't experience issues with R8 anymore (but implicitly depend on JDK Unsafe; using `GsonBuilder.disableJdkUnsafe()` would cause Gson to fail with a different exception)
- Should the Troubleshooting Guide recommend `-keep` instead of `-keepclassmembers`. In case the `<init>` rule for the class properly matches a constructor it might not matter. But in case `<init>();` is used, but a no-args constructor does not exist, then `-keep` seems to at least have the side-effect that R8 does not make the class abstract (and then using JDK Unsafe an instance can be created).

### Troubleshooting Guide: Recommend `@Keep` for Android
Instead of configuring ProGuard / R8 rules, it might be easier for Android developers to use `@Keep` on the corresponding class or constructor, see https://developer.android.com/studio/write/annotations#keep

### Preventing R8 from making classes abstract / removing no-args constructor

It would be good if we could adjust the default rules to avoid the "Abstract classes can't be instantiated!" exception (for most cases) in the first place.

There is probably no general way to detect if a class might be used with Gson, but the most reliable variant might be to keep the constructor if any of the Gson annotations is used by a class.

This can probably be achieved with an [`-if` rule](https://www.guardsquare.com/manual/configuration/usage#if) (see also [answers to this Stack Overflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/q/63162818)). For example:
```
# If class has fields with `@SerializedName` annotation keep its constructors
-if class * {
  @com.google.gson.annotations.SerializedName <fields>;
}
-keep class <1> {
  <init>(...);
}
```
(duplicated for all Gson annotations)

But it looks like this is not enough, maybe because there is no `-keep` (or `-keepclasseswithmembers`) rule for the class in the first place so `-if` somehow has no effect? You additionally need the following (duplicated for all Gson annotations probably):
```
-keepclasseswithmembers class * {
  @com.google.gson.annotations.SerializedName <fields>;
}
```
Only then the class is not made abstract and the constructor is properly kept...

(As side note: Having only the `-keepclasseswithmembers ... { @SerializedName }` above, but not the `-if ... -keep` seems to prevent R8 from making the class abstract, but still removes all constructors, so users would be dependent on JDK Unsafe then.)

Or similar to https://github.com/google/gson/issues/2379#issuecomment-1564517629 maybe the following would work as well:
```
-keepclasseswithmembers class * {
  <init>(...);
  @com.google.gson.annotations.SerializedName <fields>;
}
```
There is however probably no need for the `-if` rule shown in the original comment, unless that has some special effect, see https://github.com/google/gson/pull/2397#issuecomment-1575236086.

### R8 makes class abstract but still keeps constructors

It also looks like the Android app build creates (for some reason) additional constructors / keeps constructors even when the class is made abstract. Due to this, the Troubleshooting Guide URLs are unfortunately not included in the exception messages (they are only added at the moment when there are no constructors).
Not really sure why these constructors exist in the first place and are kept even when the class is made abstract. In the R8 integration test of Gson this behavior was not seen.

Maybe we should remove the `getDeclaredConstructors().length == 0` check if the class is abstract and always refer to the Troubleshooting Guide. The guide would have to be adjusted then though to also properly cover the case where the class was indeed abstract in the source code.

8. ## <a id="class-cast-exception"></a> `ClassCastException` when using deserialized object
9. 
10. **Symptom:** `ClassCastException` is thrown when accessing an object deserialized by Gson
11. 
12. **Reason:** Your code is most likely not type-safe
13. 
14. **Solution:** Make sure your code adheres to the following:
15. 
16. - Avoid raw types: Instead of calling `fromJson(..., List.class)`, create for example a `TypeToken<List<MyClass>>`.
17.   See the [user guide](UserGuide.md#collections-examples) for more information.
18. - When using `TypeToken` prefer the `Gson.fromJson` overloads with `TypeToken` parameter such as [`fromJson(Reader, TypeToken)`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/Gson.html#fromJson(java.io.Reader,com.google.gson.reflect.TypeToken)).
19.   The overloads with `Type` parameter do not provide any type-safety guarantees.
20. - When using `TypeToken` make sure you don't capture a type variable. For example avoid something like `new TypeToken<List<T>>()` (where `T` is a type variable). Due to Java type erasure the actual type of `T` is not available at runtime. Refactor your code to pass around `TypeToken` instances or use [`TypeToken.getParameterized(...)`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/reflect/TypeToken.html#getParameterized(java.lang.reflect.Type,java.lang.reflect.Type...)), for example `TypeToken.getParameterized(List.class, elementClass)`.
21. 
22. ## <a id="reflection-inaccessible"></a> `InaccessibleObjectException`: 'module ... does not "opens ..." to unnamed module'
23. 
24. **Symptom:** An exception with a message in the form 'module ... does not "opens ..." to unnamed module' is thrown
25. 
26. **Reason:** You use Gson by accident to access internal fields of third-party classes
27. 
28. **Solution:** Write custom Gson [`TypeAdapter`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html) implementations for the affected classes or change the type of your data. If this occurs for a field in one of your classes which you did not actually want to serialize or deserialize in the first place, you can exclude that field, see the [user guide](UserGuide.md#excluding-fields-from-serialization-and-deserialization).
29. 
30. **Explanation:**
31. 
32. When no built-in adapter for a type exists and no custom adapter has been registered, Gson falls back to using reflection to access the fields of a class (including `private` ones). Most likely you are seeing this error because you (by accident) rely on the reflection-based adapter for third-party classes. That should be avoided because you make yourself dependent on the implementation details of these classes which could change at any point. For the JDK it is also not possible anymore to access internal fields using reflection starting with JDK 17, see [JEP 403](https://openjdk.org/jeps/403).
33. 
34. If you want to prevent using reflection on third-party classes in the future you can write your own [`ReflectionAccessFilter`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/ReflectionAccessFilter.html) or use one of the predefined ones, such as `ReflectionAccessFilter.BLOCK_ALL_PLATFORM`.
35. 
36. ## <a id="reflection-inaccessible-to-module-gson"></a> `InaccessibleObjectException`: 'module ... does not "opens ..." to module com.google.gson'
37. 
38. **Symptom:** An exception with a message in the form 'module ... does not "opens ..." to module com.google.gson' is thrown
39. 
40. **Reason:**
41. 
42. - If the reported package is your own package then you have not configured the module declaration of your project to allow Gson to use reflection on your classes.
43. - If the reported package is from a third party library or the JDK see [this troubleshooting point](#inaccessibleobjectexception-module--does-not-opens--to-unnamed-module).
44. 
45. **Solution:** Make sure the `module-info.java` file of your project allows Gson to use reflection on your classes, for example:
46. 
47. ```java
48. module mymodule {
49.     requires com.google.gson;
50. 
51.     opens mypackage to com.google.gson;
52. }
53. ```
54. 
55. Or in case this occurs for a field in one of your classes which you did not actually want to serialize or deserialize in the first place, you can exclude that field, see the [user guide](UserGuide.md#excluding-fields-from-serialization-and-deserialization).
56. 
57. ## <a id="android-app-random-names"></a> Android app not working in Release mode; random property names
58. 
59. **Symptom:** Your Android app is working fine in Debug mode but fails in Release mode and the JSON properties have seemingly random names such as `a`, `b`, ...
60. 
61. **Reason:** You probably have not configured ProGuard / R8 correctly
62. 
63. **Solution:** Make sure you have configured ProGuard / R8 correctly to preserve the names of your fields. See the [Android example](examples/android-proguard-example/README.md) for more information.
64. 
65. ## <a id="android-app-broken-after-app-update"></a> Android app unable to parse JSON after app update
66. 
67. **Symptom:** You released a new version of your Android app and it fails to parse JSON data created by the previous version of your app
68. 
69. **Reason:** You probably have not configured ProGuard / R8 correctly; probably the fields names are being obfuscated and their naming changed between the versions of your app
70. 
71. **Solution:** Make sure you have configured ProGuard / R8 correctly to preserve the names of your fields. See the [Android example](examples/android-proguard-example/README.md) for more information.
72. 
73. If you want to preserve backward compatibility for you app you can use [`@SerializedName`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/annotations/SerializedName.html) on the fields to specify the obfuscated name as alternate, for example: `@SerializedName(value = "myprop", alternate = "a")`
74. 
75. Normally ProGuard and R8 produce a mapping file, this makes it easier to find out the obfuscated field names instead of having to find them out through trial and error or other means. See the [Android Studio user guide](https://developer.android.com/studio/build/shrink-code.html#retracing) for more information.
76. 
77. ## <a id="default-field-values-missing"></a> Default field values not present after deserialization
78. 
79. **Symptom:** You have assign default values to fields but after deserialization the fields have their standard value (such as `null` or `0`)
80. 
81. **Reason:** Gson cannot invoke the constructor of your class and falls back to JDK `Unsafe` (or similar means)
82. 
83. **Solution:** Make sure that the class:
84. 
85. - is `static` (explicitly or implicitly when it is a top-level class)
86. - has a no-args constructor
87. 
88. Otherwise Gson will by default try to use JDK `Unsafe` or similar means to create an instance of your class without invoking the constructor and without running any initializers. You can also disable that behavior through [`GsonBuilder.disableJdkUnsafe()`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.html#disableJdkUnsafe()) to notice such issues early on.
89. 
90. ## <a id="anonymous-local-null"></a> `null` values for anonymous and local classes
91. 
92. **Symptom:** Objects of a class are always serialized as JSON `null` / always deserialized as Java `null`
93. 
94. **Reason:** The class you are serializing or deserializing is an anonymous or a local class (or you have specified a custom `ExclusionStrategy`)
95. 
96. **Solution:** Convert the class to a `static` nested class. If the class is already `static` make sure you have not specified a Gson `ExclusionStrategy` which might exclude the class.
97. 
98. Notes:
99. 
100. - "double brace-initialization" also creates anonymous classes
101. - Local record classes (feature added in Java 16) are supported by Gson and are not affected by this
102. 
103. ## <a id="map-key-wrong-json"></a> Map keys having unexpected format in JSON
104. 
105. **Symptom:** JSON output for `Map` keys is unexpected / cannot be deserialized again
106. 
107. **Reason:** The `Map` key type is 'complex' and you have not configured the `GsonBuilder` properly
108. 
109. **Solution:** Use [`GsonBuilder.enableComplexMapKeySerialization()`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.html#enableComplexMapKeySerialization()). See also the [user guide](UserGuide.md#maps-examples) for more information.

111. ## <a id="malformed-json"></a> Parsing JSON fails with `MalformedJsonException`
112. 
113. **Symptom:** JSON parsing fails with `MalformedJsonException`
114. 
115. **Reason:** The JSON data is actually malformed
116. 
117. **Solution:** During debugging, log the JSON data right before calling Gson methods or set a breakpoint to inspect the data and make sure it has the expected format. Sometimes APIs might return HTML error pages (instead of JSON data) when reaching rate limits or when other errors occur. Also read the location information of the `MalformedJsonException` exception message, it indicates where exactly in the document the malformed data was detected, including the [JSONPath](https://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/).
118. 
119. For example, let's assume you want to deserialize the following JSON data:
120. 
121. ```json
122. {
123.   "languages": [
124.     "English",
125.     "French",
126.   ]
127. }
128. ```
129. 
130. This will fail with an exception similar to this one: `MalformedJsonException: Use JsonReader.setLenient(true) to accept malformed JSON at line 5 column 4 path $.languages[2]`  
131. The problem here is the trailing comma (`,`) after `"French"`, trailing commas are not allowed by the JSON specification. The location information "line 5 column 4" points to the `]` in the JSON data (with some slight inaccuracies) because Gson expected another value after `,` instead of the closing `]`. The JSONPath `$.languages[2]` in the exception message also points there: `$.` refers to the root object, `languages` refers to its member of that name and `[2]` refers to the (missing) third value in the JSON array value of that member (numbering starts at 0, so it is `[2]` instead of `[3]`).  
132. The proper solution here is to fix the malformed JSON data.
133. 
134. To spot syntax errors in the JSON data easily you can open it in an editor with support for JSON, for example Visual Studio Code. It will highlight within the JSON data the error location and show why the JSON data is considered invalid.
135. 
136. ## <a id="number-parsed-as-double"></a> Integral JSON number is parsed as `double`
137. 
138. **Symptom:** JSON data contains an integral number such as `45` but Gson returns it as `double`
139. 
140. **Reason:** When parsing a JSON number as `Object`, Gson will by default create always return a `double`
141. 
142. **Solution:** Use [`GsonBuilder.setObjectToNumberStrategy`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.html#setObjectToNumberStrategy(com.google.gson.ToNumberStrategy)) to specify what type of number should be returned
143. 
144. ## <a id="default-lenient"></a> Malformed JSON not rejected
145. 
146. **Symptom:** Gson parses malformed JSON without throwing any exceptions
147. 
148. **Reason:** Due to legacy reasons Gson performs parsing by default in lenient mode
149. 
150. **Solution:** See [`Gson` class documentation](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/Gson.html#default-lenient) section "Lenient JSON handling"
151. 
152. Note: Even in non-lenient mode Gson deviates slightly from the JSON specification, see [`JsonReader.setLenient`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/stream/JsonReader.html#setLenient(boolean)) for more details.
153. 
154. ## <a id="unexpected-json-structure"></a> `IllegalStateException`: "Expected ... but was ..."
155. 
156. **Symptom:** An `IllegalStateException` with a message in the form "Expected ... but was ..." is thrown
157. 
158. **Reason:** The JSON data does not have the correct format
159. 
160. **Solution:** Make sure that your classes correctly model the JSON data. Also during debugging log the JSON data right before calling Gson methods or set a breakpoint to inspect the data and make sure it has the expected format. Read the location information of the exception message, it indicates where exactly in the document the error occurred, including the [JSONPath](https://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/).
161. 
162. For example, let's assume you have the following Java class:
163. 
164. ```java
165. class WebPage {
166.     String languages;
167. }
168. ```
169. 
170. And you want to deserialize the following JSON data:
171. 
172. ```json
173. {
174.   "languages": ["English", "French"]
175. }
176. ```
177. 
178. This will fail with an exception similar to this one: `IllegalStateException: Expected a string but was BEGIN_ARRAY at line 2 column 17 path $.languages`  
179. This means Gson expected a JSON string value but found the beginning of a JSON array (`[`). The location information "line 2 column 17" points to the `[` in the JSON data (with some slight inaccuracies), so does the JSONPath `$.languages` in the exception message. It refers to the `languages` member of the root object (`$.`).  
180. The solution here is to change in the `WebPage` class the field `String languages` to `List<String> languages`.
181. 
182. ## <a id="adapter-not-null-safe"></a> `IllegalStateException`: "Expected ... but was NULL"
183. 
184. **Symptom:** An `IllegalStateException` with a message in the form "Expected ... but was NULL" is thrown
185. 
186. **Reason:**
187. 
188. - A built-in adapter does not support JSON null values
189. - You have written a custom `TypeAdapter` which does not properly handle JSON null values
190. 
191. **Solution:** If this occurs for a custom adapter you wrote, add code similar to the following at the beginning of its `read` method:
192. 
193. ```java
194. @Override
195. public MyClass read(JsonReader in) throws IOException {
196.     if (in.peek() == JsonToken.NULL) {
197.         in.nextNull();
198.         return null;
199.     }
200. 
201.     ...
202. }
203. ```
204. 
205. Alternatively you can call [`nullSafe()`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html#nullSafe()) on the adapter instance you created.
206. 
207. ## <a id="serialize-nulls"></a> Properties missing in JSON
208. 
209. **Symptom:** Properties are missing in the JSON output
210. 
211. **Reason:** Gson by default omits JSON null from the output (or: ProGuard / R8 is not configured correctly and removed unused fields)
212. 
213. **Solution:** Use [`GsonBuilder.serializeNulls()`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.html#serializeNulls())
214. 
215. Note: Gson does not support anonymous and local classes and will serialize them as JSON null, see the [related troubleshooting point](#null-values-for-anonymous-and-local-classes).
216. 
217. ## <a id="android-internal-fields"></a> JSON output changes for newer Android versions
218. 
219. **Symptom:** The JSON output differs when running on newer Android versions
220. 
221. **Reason:** You use Gson by accident to access internal fields of Android classes
222. 
223. **Solution:** Write custom Gson [`TypeAdapter`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html) implementations for the affected classes or change the type of your data
224. 
225. **Explanation:**
226. 
227. When no built-in adapter for a type exists and no custom adapter has been registered, Gson falls back to using reflection to access the fields of a class (including `private` ones). Most likely you are experiencing this issue because you (by accident) rely on the reflection-based adapter for Android classes. That should be avoided because you make yourself dependent on the implementation details of these classes which could change at any point.
228. 
229. If you want to prevent using reflection on third-party classes in the future you can write your own [`ReflectionAccessFilter`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/ReflectionAccessFilter.html) or use one of the predefined ones, such as `ReflectionAccessFilter.BLOCK_ALL_PLATFORM`.
230. 
231. ## <a id="json-static-fields"></a> JSON output contains values of `static` fields
232. 
233. **Symptom:** The JSON output contains values of `static` fields
234. 
235. **Reason:** You used `GsonBuilder.excludeFieldsWithModifiers` to overwrite the default excluded modifiers
236. 
237. **Solution:** When calling `GsonBuilder.excludeFieldsWithModifiers` you overwrite the default excluded modifiers. Therefore, you have to explicitly exclude `static` fields if desired. This can be done by adding `Modifier.STATIC` as additional argument.
238. 
239. ## <a id="no-such-method-error"></a> `NoSuchMethodError` when calling Gson methods
240. 
241. **Symptom:** A `java.lang.NoSuchMethodError` is thrown when trying to call certain Gson methods
242. 
243. **Reason:**
244. 
245. - You have multiple versions of Gson on your classpath
246. - Or, the Gson version you compiled against is different from the one on your classpath
247. - Or, you are using a code shrinking tool such as ProGuard or R8 which removed methods from Gson
248. 
249. **Solution:** First disable any code shrinking tools such as ProGuard or R8 and check if the issue persists. If not, you have to tweak the configuration of that tool to not modify Gson classes. Otherwise verify that the Gson JAR on your classpath is the same you are compiling against, and that there is only one Gson JAR on your classpath. See [this Stack Overflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/q/227486) to find out where a class is loaded from. For example, for debugging you could include the following code:
250. 
251. ```java
252. System.out.println(Gson.class.getProtectionDomain().getCodeSource().getLocation());
253. ```
254. 
255. If that fails with a `NullPointerException` you have to try one of the other ways to find out where a class is loaded from.
256. 
257. ## <a id="duplicate-fields"></a> `IllegalArgumentException`: 'Class ... declares multiple JSON fields named '...''
258. 
259. **Symptom:** An exception with the message 'Class ... declares multiple JSON fields named '...'' is thrown
260. 
261. **Reason:**
262. 
263. - The name you have specified with a [`@SerializedName`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/annotations/SerializedName.html) annotation for a field collides with the name of another field
264. - The [`FieldNamingStrategy`](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/FieldNamingStrategy.html) you have specified produces conflicting field names
265. - A field of your class has the same name as the field of a superclass
266. 
267. Gson prevents multiple fields with the same name because during deserialization it would be ambiguous for which field the JSON data should be deserialized. For serialization it would cause the same field to appear multiple times in JSON. While the JSON specification permits this, it is likely that the application parsing the JSON data will not handle it correctly.
268. 
269. **Solution:** First identify the fields with conflicting names based on the exception message. Then decide if you want to rename one of them using the [`@SerializedName`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/annotations/SerializedName.html) annotation, or if you want to [exclude](UserGuide.md#excluding-fields-from-serialization-and-deserialization) one of them. When excluding one of the fields you have to include it for both serialization and deserialization (even if your application only performs one of these actions) because the duplicate field check cannot differentiate between these actions.
270. 
271. ## <a id="java-lang-class-unsupported"></a> `UnsupportedOperationException` when serializing or deserializing `java.lang.Class`
272. 
273. **Symptom:** An `UnsupportedOperationException` is thrown when trying to serialize or deserialize `java.lang.Class`
274. 
275. **Reason:** Gson intentionally does not permit serializing and deserializing `java.lang.Class` for security reasons. Otherwise a malicious user could make your application load an arbitrary class from the classpath and, depending on what your application does with the `Class`, in the worst case perform a remote code execution attack.
276. 
277. **Solution:** First check if you really need to serialize or deserialize a `Class`. Often it is possible to use string aliases and then map them to the known `Class`; you could write a custom [`TypeAdapter`](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html) to do this. If the `Class` values are not known in advance, try to introduce a common base class or interface for all these classes and then verify that the deserialized class is a subclass. For example assuming the base class is called `MyBaseClass`, your custom `TypeAdapter` should load the class like this:
278. 
279. ```java
280. Class.forName(jsonString, false, getClass().getClassLoader()).asSubclass(MyBaseClass.class)
281. ```
282. 
283. This will not initialize arbitrary classes, and it will throw a `ClassCastException` if the loaded class is not the same as or a subclass of `MyBaseClass`.
284. 
285. ## <a id="type-token-raw"></a> `IllegalStateException`: 'TypeToken must be created with a type argument' <br> `RuntimeException`: 'Missing type parameter'
286. 
287. **Symptom:** An `IllegalStateException` with the message 'TypeToken must be created with a type argument' is thrown.  
288. For older Gson versions a `RuntimeException` with message 'Missing type parameter' is thrown.
289. 
290. **Reason:**
291. 
292. - You created a `TypeToken` without type argument, for example `new TypeToken() {}` (note the missing `<...>`). You always have to provide the type argument, for example like this: `new TypeToken<List<String>>() {}`. Normally the compiler will also emit a 'raw types' warning when you forget the `<...>`.
293. - You are using a code shrinking tool such as ProGuard or R8 (Android app builds normally have this enabled by default) but have not configured it correctly for usage with Gson.
294. 
295. **Solution:** When you are using a code shrinking tool such as ProGuard or R8 you have to adjust your configuration to include the following rules:
296. 
297. ```
298. # Keep generic signatures; needed for correct type resolution
299. -keepattributes Signature
300. 
301. # Keep class TypeToken (respectively its generic signature)
302. -keep class com.google.gson.reflect.TypeToken { *; }
303. 
304. # Keep any (anonymous) classes extending TypeToken
305. -keep class * extends com.google.gson.reflect.TypeToken
306. ```
307. 
308. See also the [Android example](examples/android-proguard-example/README.md) for more information.
309. 
310. Note: For newer Gson versions these rules might be applied automatically; make sure you are using the latest Gson version and the latest version of the code shrinking tool.
311. 
312. ## <a id="r8-abstract-class"></a> `JsonIOException`: 'Abstract classes can't be instantiated!' (R8)
313. 
314. **Symptom:** A `JsonIOException` with the message 'Abstract classes can't be instantiated!' is thrown; the class mentioned in the exception message is not actually `abstract` in your source code, and you are using the code shrinking tool R8 (Android app builds normally have this configured by default).
315. 
316. **Reason:** The code shrinking tool R8 performs optimizations where it removes the no-args constructor from a class and makes the class `abstract`. Due to this Gson cannot create an instance of the class.
317. 
318. **Solution:** Make sure the class has a no-args constructor, then adjust your R8 configuration file to keep the constructor of the class. For example:
319. 
320. ```
321. # Keep the no-args constructor of the deserialized class
322. -keepclassmembers class com.example.MyClass {
323.   <init>();
324. }
325. ```
326. 
327. For Android you can add this rule to the `proguard-rules.pro` file, see also the [Android documentation](https://developer.android.com/build/shrink-code#keep-code). In case the class name in the exception message is obfuscated, see the Android documentation about [retracing](https://developer.android.com/build/shrink-code#retracing).
328. 
329. Note: If the class which you are trying to deserialize is actually abstract, then this exception is probably unrelated to R8 and you will have to implement a custom [`InstanceCreator`](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/InstanceCreator.html) or [`TypeAdapter`](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html) which creates an instance of a non-abstract subclass of the class.

--- END AGGREGATED CONTEXT ---

Analyze if the current context is sufficient to complete the user query by considering:
1. Do you understand the full scope and requirements of the user query?
2. Do you have access to all relevant code that needs to be examined or modified?
3. Are all critical dependencies and their interfaces visible?
4. Is there enough context about the system architecture and design patterns?
5. Do you have access to relevant documentation or tests if needed?

Only request additional context if essential information is missing. Ensure you're not requesting:
- Information already provided in previous queries
- Nice-to-have but non-essential details
- Implementation details that aren't relevant to the current task

If additional context is needed:
- Be specific about what you're looking for
- Consider both code and documentation that might be relevant

IMPORTANT:
- Try to avoid asking for the SAME or very similar information as previous queries, because these queries have already been asked and satisfied.

2025-11-09 02:39:14,917 - thread-140613253072576.prometheus.lang_graph.nodes.context_extraction_node - DEBUG - This is the query you need to answer:

--- BEGIN QUERY ---
Please provide the contents of gson/src/main/resources/META-INF/proguard/gson.pro, examples/android-proguard-example/README.md, all files in gson/src/main/java/com/google/gson/annotations/, and the source file which defines TroubleshootingGuide.createUrl.
--- END QUERY ---

--- BEGIN EXTRA REQUIREMENTS ---
If sending all annotation files is large, include at minimum the names and packages of all Gson annotations; for TroubleshootingGuide provide its class path and the createUrl method signature and URL format used.
--- END EXTRA REQUIREMENTS ---

--- BEGIN PURPOSE ---
This context is required to integrate rule changes, craft accurate -if/-keep rules based on annotations, and adjust documentation and error messaging consistently.
--- END PURPOSE ---

The context or file content that you have seen so far (Some of the context may be IRRELEVANT to the query!!!):

Line number range: 1 - 17
Content:
1. # android-proguard-example
2. 
3. Example Android project showing how to properly configure [ProGuard](https://www.guardsquare.com/proguard).
4. ProGuard is a tool for 'shrinking' and obfuscating compiled classes. It can rename methods and fields,
5. or remove them if they appear to be unused. This can cause issues for Gson which uses Java reflection to
6. access the fields of a class. It is necessary to configure ProGuard to make sure that Gson works correctly.
7. 
8. Also have a look at the [ProGuard manual](https://www.guardsquare.com/manual/configuration/usage#keepoverview)
9. and the [ProGuard Gson examples](https://www.guardsquare.com/manual/configuration/examples#gson) for more
10. details on how ProGuard can be configured.
11. 
12. The R8 code shrinker uses the same rule format as ProGuard, but there are differences between these two
13. tools. Have a look at R8's Compatibility FAQ, and especially at the [Gson section](https://r8.googlesource.com/r8/+/refs/heads/main/compatibility-faq.md#gson).
14. 
15. Note that newer Gson versions apply some of the rules shown in `proguard.cfg` automatically by default,
16. see the file [`gson/META-INF/proguard/gson.pro`](/gson/src/main/resources/META-INF/proguard/gson.pro) for
17. the Gson version you are using.

31.  * {@link com.google.gson.GsonBuilder#excludeFieldsWithoutExposeAnnotation()}
32.  * method.</p>

34.  * <p>Here is an example of how this annotation is meant to be used:
35.  * <pre>
36.  * public class User {
37.  *   &#64;Expose private String firstName;

40.  *   private String password;
41.  * }
42.  * </pre>
43.  * If you created Gson with {@code new Gson()}, the {@code toJson()} and {@code fromJson()}
44.  * methods will use the {@code password} field along-with {@code firstName}, {@code lastName},
45.  * and {@code emailAddress} for serialization and deserialization. However, if you created Gson
46.  * with {@code Gson gson = new GsonBuilder().excludeFieldsWithoutExposeAnnotation().create()}
47.  * then the {@code toJson()} and {@code fromJson()} methods of Gson will exclude the
48.  * {@code password} field. This is because the {@code password} field is not marked with the
49.  * {@code @Expose} annotation. Gson will also exclude {@code lastName} and {@code emailAddress}
50.  * from serialization since {@code serialize} is set to {@code false}. Similarly, Gson will
51.  * exclude {@code emailAddress} from deserialization since {@code deserialize} is set to false.
52.  *
53.  * <p>Note that another way to achieve the same effect would have been to just mark the
54.  * {@code password} field as {@code transient}, and Gson would have excluded it even with default
55.  * settings. The {@code @Expose} annotation is useful in a style of programming where you want to
56.  * explicitly specify all fields that should get considered for serialization or deserialization.

Issue title:
Improve default ProGuard / R8 rules and Troubleshooting Guide

Issue description: 
# Problem solved by the feature
Improve the default ProGuard / R8 rules in `META-INF/proguard/gson.pro` added by #2397, and the Troubleshooting Guide.

# Feature description
I was testing the new default rules with an Android app and Kotlin classes, and there might be the following areas to improve.

### Troubleshooting Guide: `JsonIOException`: 'Abstract classes can't be instantiated!' (R8)

The Troubleshooting Guide currently suggests the following:
```
# Keep the no-args constructor of the deserialized class
-keepclassmembers class com.example.MyClass {
  <init>();
}
```

This means only the no-args constructor is kept, but not any other constructors. However, especially for Kotlin I assume it is common that classes don't have a no-args constructor because you might declare properties and the primary constructor at once, e.g. `class MyClass(val s: String)` (see [Kotlin documentation](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/classes.html#constructors)). Not sure though if using that is a good idea in combination with Gson because it then requires JDK Unsafe to create instances, but that is a different topic.

So there are two questions:
- Should the Troubleshooting Guide rather recommend `<init>(...);` (all constructors), so that the users don't experience issues with R8 anymore (but implicitly depend on JDK Unsafe; using `GsonBuilder.disableJdkUnsafe()` would cause Gson to fail with a different exception)
- Should the Troubleshooting Guide recommend `-keep` instead of `-keepclassmembers`. In case the `<init>` rule for the class properly matches a constructor it might not matter. But in case `<init>();` is used, but a no-args constructor does not exist, then `-keep` seems to at least have the side-effect that R8 does not make the class abstract (and then using JDK Unsafe an instance can be created).

### Troubleshooting Guide: Recommend `@Keep` for Android
Instead of configuring ProGuard / R8 rules, it might be easier for Android developers to use `@Keep` on the corresponding class or constructor, see https://developer.android.com/studio/write/annotations#keep

### Preventing R8 from making classes abstract / removing no-args constructor

It would be good if we could adjust the default rules to avoid the "Abstract classes can't be instantiated!" exception (for most cases) in the first place.

There is probably no general way to detect if a class might be used with Gson, but the most reliable variant might be to keep the constructor if any of the Gson annotations is used by a class.

This can probably be achieved with an [`-if` rule](https://www.guardsquare.com/manual/configuration/usage#if) (see also [answers to this Stack Overflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/q/63162818)). For example:
```
# If class has fields with `@SerializedName` annotation keep its constructors
-if class * {
  @com.google.gson.annotations.SerializedName <fields>;
}
-keep class <1> {
  <init>(...);
}
```
(duplicated for all Gson annotations)

But it looks like this is not enough, maybe because there is no `-keep` (or `-keepclasseswithmembers`) rule for the class in the first place so `-if` somehow has no effect? You additionally need the following (duplicated for all Gson annotations probably):
```
-keepclasseswithmembers class * {
  @com.google.gson.annotations.SerializedName <fields>;
}
```
Only then the class is not made abstract and the constructor is properly kept...

(As side note: Having only the `-keepclasseswithmembers ... { @SerializedName }` above, but not the `-if ... -keep` seems to prevent R8 from making the class abstract, but still removes all constructors, so users would be dependent on JDK Unsafe then.)

Or similar to https://github.com/google/gson/issues/2379#issuecomment-1564517629 maybe the following would work as well:
```
-keepclasseswithmembers class * {
  <init>(...);
  @com.google.gson.annotations.SerializedName <fields>;
}
```
There is however probably no need for the `-if` rule shown in the original comment, unless that has some special effect, see https://github.com/google/gson/pull/2397#issuecomment-1575236086.

### R8 makes class abstract but still keeps constructors

It also looks like the Android app build creates (for some reason) additional constructors / keeps constructors even when the class is made abstract. Due to this, the Troubleshooting Guide URLs are unfortunately not included in the exception messages (they are only added at the moment when there are no constructors).
Not really sure why these constructors exist in the first place and are kept even when the class is made abstract. In the R8 integration test of Gson this behavior was not seen.

Maybe we should remove the `getDeclaredConstructors().length == 0` check if the class is abstract and always refer to the Troubleshooting Guide. The guide would have to be adjusted then though to also properly cover the case where the class was indeed abstract in the source code.

8. ## <a id="class-cast-exception"></a> `ClassCastException` when using deserialized object
9. 
10. **Symptom:** `ClassCastException` is thrown when accessing an object deserialized by Gson
11. 
12. **Reason:** Your code is most likely not type-safe
13. 
14. **Solution:** Make sure your code adheres to the following:
15. 
16. - Avoid raw types: Instead of calling `fromJson(..., List.class)`, create for example a `TypeToken<List<MyClass>>`.
17.   See the [user guide](UserGuide.md#collections-examples) for more information.
18. - When using `TypeToken` prefer the `Gson.fromJson` overloads with `TypeToken` parameter such as [`fromJson(Reader, TypeToken)`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/Gson.html#fromJson(java.io.Reader,com.google.gson.reflect.TypeToken)).
19.   The overloads with `Type` parameter do not provide any type-safety guarantees.
20. - When using `TypeToken` make sure you don't capture a type variable. For example avoid something like `new TypeToken<List<T>>()` (where `T` is a type variable). Due to Java type erasure the actual type of `T` is not available at runtime. Refactor your code to pass around `TypeToken` instances or use [`TypeToken.getParameterized(...)`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/reflect/TypeToken.html#getParameterized(java.lang.reflect.Type,java.lang.reflect.Type...)), for example `TypeToken.getParameterized(List.class, elementClass)`.
21. 
22. ## <a id="reflection-inaccessible"></a> `InaccessibleObjectException`: 'module ... does not "opens ..." to unnamed module'
23. 
24. **Symptom:** An exception with a message in the form 'module ... does not "opens ..." to unnamed module' is thrown
25. 
26. **Reason:** You use Gson by accident to access internal fields of third-party classes
27. 
28. **Solution:** Write custom Gson [`TypeAdapter`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html) implementations for the affected classes or change the type of your data. If this occurs for a field in one of your classes which you did not actually want to serialize or deserialize in the first place, you can exclude that field, see the [user guide](UserGuide.md#excluding-fields-from-serialization-and-deserialization).
29. 
30. **Explanation:**
31. 
32. When no built-in adapter for a type exists and no custom adapter has been registered, Gson falls back to using reflection to access the fields of a class (including `private` ones). Most likely you are seeing this error because you (by accident) rely on the reflection-based adapter for third-party classes. That should be avoided because you make yourself dependent on the implementation details of these classes which could change at any point. For the JDK it is also not possible anymore to access internal fields using reflection starting with JDK 17, see [JEP 403](https://openjdk.org/jeps/403).
33. 
34. If you want to prevent using reflection on third-party classes in the future you can write your own [`ReflectionAccessFilter`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/ReflectionAccessFilter.html) or use one of the predefined ones, such as `ReflectionAccessFilter.BLOCK_ALL_PLATFORM`.
35. 
36. ## <a id="reflection-inaccessible-to-module-gson"></a> `InaccessibleObjectException`: 'module ... does not "opens ..." to module com.google.gson'
37. 
38. **Symptom:** An exception with a message in the form 'module ... does not "opens ..." to module com.google.gson' is thrown
39. 
40. **Reason:**
41. 
42. - If the reported package is your own package then you have not configured the module declaration of your project to allow Gson to use reflection on your classes.
43. - If the reported package is from a third party library or the JDK see [this troubleshooting point](#inaccessibleobjectexception-module--does-not-opens--to-unnamed-module).
44. 
45. **Solution:** Make sure the `module-info.java` file of your project allows Gson to use reflection on your classes, for example:
46. 
47. ```java
48. module mymodule {
49.     requires com.google.gson;
50. 
51.     opens mypackage to com.google.gson;
52. }
53. ```
54. 
55. Or in case this occurs for a field in one of your classes which you did not actually want to serialize or deserialize in the first place, you can exclude that field, see the [user guide](UserGuide.md#excluding-fields-from-serialization-and-deserialization).
56. 
57. ## <a id="android-app-random-names"></a> Android app not working in Release mode; random property names
58. 
59. **Symptom:** Your Android app is working fine in Debug mode but fails in Release mode and the JSON properties have seemingly random names such as `a`, `b`, ...
60. 
61. **Reason:** You probably have not configured ProGuard / R8 correctly
62. 
63. **Solution:** Make sure you have configured ProGuard / R8 correctly to preserve the names of your fields. See the [Android example](examples/android-proguard-example/README.md) for more information.
64. 
65. ## <a id="android-app-broken-after-app-update"></a> Android app unable to parse JSON after app update
66. 
67. **Symptom:** You released a new version of your Android app and it fails to parse JSON data created by the previous version of your app
68. 
69. **Reason:** You probably have not configured ProGuard / R8 correctly; probably the fields names are being obfuscated and their naming changed between the versions of your app
70. 
71. **Solution:** Make sure you have configured ProGuard / R8 correctly to preserve the names of your fields. See the [Android example](examples/android-proguard-example/README.md) for more information.
72. 
73. If you want to preserve backward compatibility for you app you can use [`@SerializedName`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/annotations/SerializedName.html) on the fields to specify the obfuscated name as alternate, for example: `@SerializedName(value = "myprop", alternate = "a")`
74. 
75. Normally ProGuard and R8 produce a mapping file, this makes it easier to find out the obfuscated field names instead of having to find them out through trial and error or other means. See the [Android Studio user guide](https://developer.android.com/studio/build/shrink-code.html#retracing) for more information.
76. 
77. ## <a id="default-field-values-missing"></a> Default field values not present after deserialization
78. 
79. **Symptom:** You have assign default values to fields but after deserialization the fields have their standard value (such as `null` or `0`)
80. 
81. **Reason:** Gson cannot invoke the constructor of your class and falls back to JDK `Unsafe` (or similar means)
82. 
83. **Solution:** Make sure that the class:
84. 
85. - is `static` (explicitly or implicitly when it is a top-level class)
86. - has a no-args constructor
87. 
88. Otherwise Gson will by default try to use JDK `Unsafe` or similar means to create an instance of your class without invoking the constructor and without running any initializers. You can also disable that behavior through [`GsonBuilder.disableJdkUnsafe()`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.html#disableJdkUnsafe()) to notice such issues early on.
89. 
90. ## <a id="anonymous-local-null"></a> `null` values for anonymous and local classes
91. 
92. **Symptom:** Objects of a class are always serialized as JSON `null` / always deserialized as Java `null`
93. 
94. **Reason:** The class you are serializing or deserializing is an anonymous or a local class (or you have specified a custom `ExclusionStrategy`)
95. 
96. **Solution:** Convert the class to a `static` nested class. If the class is already `static` make sure you have not specified a Gson `ExclusionStrategy` which might exclude the class.
97. 
98. Notes:
99. 
100. - "double brace-initialization" also creates anonymous classes
101. - Local record classes (feature added in Java 16) are supported by Gson and are not affected by this
102. 
103. ## <a id="map-key-wrong-json"></a> Map keys having unexpected format in JSON
104. 
105. **Symptom:** JSON output for `Map` keys is unexpected / cannot be deserialized again
106. 
107. **Reason:** The `Map` key type is 'complex' and you have not configured the `GsonBuilder` properly
108. 
109. **Solution:** Use [`GsonBuilder.enableComplexMapKeySerialization()`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.html#enableComplexMapKeySerialization()). See also the [user guide](UserGuide.md#maps-examples) for more information.
110. 
111. ## <a id="malformed-json"></a> Parsing JSON fails with `MalformedJsonException`
112. 
113. **Symptom:** JSON parsing fails with `MalformedJsonException`
114. 
115. **Reason:** The JSON data is actually malformed
116. 
117. **Solution:** During debugging, log the JSON data right before calling Gson methods or set a breakpoint to inspect the data and make sure it has the expected format. Sometimes APIs might return HTML error pages (instead of JSON data) when reaching rate limits or when other errors occur. Also read the location information of the `MalformedJsonException` exception message, it indicates where exactly in the document the malformed data was detected, including the [JSONPath](https://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/).
118. 
119. For example, let's assume you want to deserialize the following JSON data:
120. 
121. ```json
122. {
123.   "languages": [
124.     "English",
125.     "French",
126.   ]
127. }
128. ```
129. 
130. This will fail with an exception similar to this one: `MalformedJsonException: Use JsonReader.setLenient(true) to accept malformed JSON at line 5 column 4 path $.languages[2]`  
131. The problem here is the trailing comma (`,`) after `"French"`, trailing commas are not allowed by the JSON specification. The location information "line 5 column 4" points to the `]` in the JSON data (with some slight inaccuracies) because Gson expected another value after `,` instead of the closing `]`. The JSONPath `$.languages[2]` in the exception message also points there: `$.` refers to the root object, `languages` refers to its member of that name and `[2]` refers to the (missing) third value in the JSON array value of that member (numbering starts at 0, so it is `[2]` instead of `[3]`).  
132. The proper solution here is to fix the malformed JSON data.
133. 
134. To spot syntax errors in the JSON data easily you can open it in an editor with support for JSON, for example Visual Studio Code. It will highlight within the JSON data the error location and show why the JSON data is considered invalid.
135. 
136. ## <a id="number-parsed-as-double"></a> Integral JSON number is parsed as `double`
137. 
138. **Symptom:** JSON data contains an integral number such as `45` but Gson returns it as `double`
139. 
140. **Reason:** When parsing a JSON number as `Object`, Gson will by default create always return a `double`
141. 
142. **Solution:** Use [`GsonBuilder.setObjectToNumberStrategy`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.html#setObjectToNumberStrategy(com.google.gson.ToNumberStrategy)) to specify what type of number should be returned
143. 
144. ## <a id="default-lenient"></a> Malformed JSON not rejected
145. 
146. **Symptom:** Gson parses malformed JSON without throwing any exceptions
147. 
148. **Reason:** Due to legacy reasons Gson performs parsing by default in lenient mode
149. 
150. **Solution:** See [`Gson` class documentation](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/Gson.html#default-lenient) section "Lenient JSON handling"
151. 
152. Note: Even in non-lenient mode Gson deviates slightly from the JSON specification, see [`JsonReader.setLenient`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/stream/JsonReader.html#setLenient(boolean)) for more details.
153. 
154. ## <a id="unexpected-json-structure"></a> `IllegalStateException`: "Expected ... but was ..."
155. 
156. **Symptom:** An `IllegalStateException` with a message in the form "Expected ... but was ..." is thrown
157. 
158. **Reason:** The JSON data does not have the correct format
159. 
160. **Solution:** Make sure that your classes correctly model the JSON data. Also during debugging log the JSON data right before calling Gson methods or set a breakpoint to inspect the data and make sure it has the expected format. Read the location information of the exception message, it indicates where exactly in the document the error occurred, including the [JSONPath](https://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/).
161. 
162. For example, let's assume you have the following Java class:
163. 
164. ```java
165. class WebPage {
166.     String languages;
167. }
168. ```
169. 
170. And you want to deserialize the following JSON data:
171. 
172. ```json
173. {
174.   "languages": ["English", "French"]
175. }
176. ```
177. 
178. This will fail with an exception similar to this one: `IllegalStateException: Expected a string but was BEGIN_ARRAY at line 2 column 17 path $.languages`  
179. This means Gson expected a JSON string value but found the beginning of a JSON array (`[`). The location information "line 2 column 17" points to the `[` in the JSON data (with some slight inaccuracies), so does the JSONPath `$.languages` in the exception message. It refers to the `languages` member of the root object (`$.`).  
180. The solution here is to change in the `WebPage` class the field `String languages` to `List<String> languages`.
181. 
182. ## <a id="adapter-not-null-safe"></a> `IllegalStateException`: "Expected ... but was NULL"
183. 
184. **Symptom:** An `IllegalStateException` with a message in the form "Expected ... but was NULL" is thrown
185. 
186. **Reason:**
187. 
188. - A built-in adapter does not support JSON null values
189. - You have written a custom `TypeAdapter` which does not properly handle JSON null values
190. 
191. **Solution:** If this occurs for a custom adapter you wrote, add code similar to the following at the beginning of its `read` method:
192. 
193. ```java
194. @Override
195. public MyClass read(JsonReader in) throws IOException {
196.     if (in.peek() == JsonToken.NULL) {
197.         in.nextNull();
198.         return null;
199.     }
200. 
201.     ...
202. }
203. ```
204. 
205. Alternatively you can call [`nullSafe()`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html#nullSafe()) on the adapter instance you created.
206. 
207. ## <a id="serialize-nulls"></a> Properties missing in JSON
208. 
209. **Symptom:** Properties are missing in the JSON output
210. 
211. **Reason:** Gson by default omits JSON null from the output (or: ProGuard / R8 is not configured correctly and removed unused fields)
212. 
213. **Solution:** Use [`GsonBuilder.serializeNulls()`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.html#serializeNulls())
214. 
215. Note: Gson does not support anonymous and local classes and will serialize them as JSON null, see the [related troubleshooting point](#null-values-for-anonymous-and-local-classes).
216. 
217. ## <a id="android-internal-fields"></a> JSON output changes for newer Android versions
218. 
219. **Symptom:** The JSON output differs when running on newer Android versions
220. 
221. **Reason:** You use Gson by accident to access internal fields of Android classes
222. 
223. **Solution:** Write custom Gson [`TypeAdapter`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html) implementations for the affected classes or change the type of your data
224. 
225. **Explanation:**
226. 
227. When no built-in adapter for a type exists and no custom adapter has been registered, Gson falls back to using reflection to access the fields of a class (including `private` ones). Most likely you are experiencing this issue because you (by accident) rely on the reflection-based adapter for Android classes. That should be avoided because you make yourself dependent on the implementation details of these classes which could change at any point.
228. 
229. If you want to prevent using reflection on third-party classes in the future you can write your own [`ReflectionAccessFilter`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/ReflectionAccessFilter.html) or use one of the predefined ones, such as `ReflectionAccessFilter.BLOCK_ALL_PLATFORM`.
230. 
231. ## <a id="json-static-fields"></a> JSON output contains values of `static` fields
232. 
233. **Symptom:** The JSON output contains values of `static` fields
234. 
235. **Reason:** You used `GsonBuilder.excludeFieldsWithModifiers` to overwrite the default excluded modifiers
236. 
237. **Solution:** When calling `GsonBuilder.excludeFieldsWithModifiers` you overwrite the default excluded modifiers. Therefore, you have to explicitly exclude `static` fields if desired. This can be done by adding `Modifier.STATIC` as additional argument.
238. 
239. ## <a id="no-such-method-error"></a> `NoSuchMethodError` when calling Gson methods
240. 
241. **Symptom:** A `java.lang.NoSuchMethodError` is thrown when trying to call certain Gson methods
242. 
243. **Reason:**
244. 
245. - You have multiple versions of Gson on your classpath
246. - Or, the Gson version you compiled against is different from the one on your classpath
247. - Or, you are using a code shrinking tool such as ProGuard or R8 which removed methods from Gson
248. 
249. **Solution:** First disable any code shrinking tools such as ProGuard or R8 and check if the issue persists. If not, you have to tweak the configuration of that tool to not modify Gson classes. Otherwise verify that the Gson JAR on your classpath is the same you are compiling against, and that there is only one Gson JAR on your classpath. See [this Stack Overflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/q/227486) to find out where a class is loaded from. For example, for debugging you could include the following code:
250. 
251. ```java
252. System.out.println(Gson.class.getProtectionDomain().getCodeSource().getLocation());
253. ```
254. 
255. If that fails with a `NullPointerException` you have to try one of the other ways to find out where a class is loaded from.
256. 
257. ## <a id="duplicate-fields"></a> `IllegalArgumentException`: 'Class ... declares multiple JSON fields named '...''
258. 
259. **Symptom:** An exception with the message 'Class ... declares multiple JSON fields named '...'' is thrown
260. 
261. **Reason:**
262. 
263. - The name you have specified with a [`@SerializedName`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/annotations/SerializedName.html) annotation for a field collides with the name of another field
264. - The [`FieldNamingStrategy`](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/FieldNamingStrategy.html) you have specified produces conflicting field names
265. - A field of your class has the same name as the field of a superclass
266. 
267. Gson prevents multiple fields with the same name because during deserialization it would be ambiguous for which field the JSON data should be deserialized. For serialization it would cause the same field to appear multiple times in JSON. While the JSON specification permits this, it is likely that the application parsing the JSON data will not handle it correctly.
268. 
269. **Solution:** First identify the fields with conflicting names based on the exception message. Then decide if you want to rename one of them using the [`@SerializedName`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/annotations/SerializedName.html) annotation, or if you want to [exclude](UserGuide.md#excluding-fields-from-serialization-and-deserialization) one of them. When excluding one of the fields you have to include it for both serialization and deserialization (even if your application only performs one of these actions) because the duplicate field check cannot differentiate between these actions.
270. 
271. ## <a id="java-lang-class-unsupported"></a> `UnsupportedOperationException` when serializing or deserializing `java.lang.Class`
272. 
273. **Symptom:** An `UnsupportedOperationException` is thrown when trying to serialize or deserialize `java.lang.Class`
274. 
275. **Reason:** Gson intentionally does not permit serializing and deserializing `java.lang.Class` for security reasons. Otherwise a malicious user could make your application load an arbitrary class from the classpath and, depending on what your application does with the `Class`, in the worst case perform a remote code execution attack.
276. 
277. **Solution:** First check if you really need to serialize or deserialize a `Class`. Often it is possible to use string aliases and then map them to the known `Class`; you could write a custom [`TypeAdapter`](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html) to do this. If the `Class` values are not known in advance, try to introduce a common base class or interface for all these classes and then verify that the deserialized class is a subclass. For example assuming the base class is called `MyBaseClass`, your custom `TypeAdapter` should load the class like this:
278. 
279. ```java
280. Class.forName(jsonString, false, getClass().getClassLoader()).asSubclass(MyBaseClass.class)
281. ```
282. 
283. This will not initialize arbitrary classes, and it will throw a `ClassCastException` if the loaded class is not the same as or a subclass of `MyBaseClass`.
284. 
285. ## <a id="type-token-raw"></a> `IllegalStateException`: 'TypeToken must be created with a type argument' <br> `RuntimeException`: 'Missing type parameter'
286. 
287. **Symptom:** An `IllegalStateException` with the message 'TypeToken must be created with a type argument' is thrown.  
288. For older Gson versions a `RuntimeException` with message 'Missing type parameter' is thrown.
289. 
290. **Reason:**
291. 
292. - You created a `TypeToken` without type argument, for example `new TypeToken() {}` (note the missing `<...>`). You always have to provide the type argument, for example like this: `new TypeToken<List<String>>() {}`. Normally the compiler will also emit a 'raw types' warning when you forget the `<...>`.
293. - You are using a code shrinking tool such as ProGuard or R8 (Android app builds normally have this enabled by default) but have not configured it correctly for usage with Gson.
294. 
295. **Solution:** When you are using a code shrinking tool such as ProGuard or R8 you have to adjust your configuration to include the following rules:
296. 
297. ```
298. # Keep generic signatures; needed for correct type resolution
299. -keepattributes Signature
300. 
301. # Keep class TypeToken (respectively its generic signature)
302. -keep class com.google.gson.reflect.TypeToken { *; }
303. 
304. # Keep any (anonymous) classes extending TypeToken
305. -keep class * extends com.google.gson.reflect.TypeToken
306. ```
307. 
308. See also the [Android example](examples/android-proguard-example/README.md) for more information.
309. 
310. Note: For newer Gson versions these rules might be applied automatically; make sure you are using the latest Gson version and the latest version of the code shrinking tool.
311. 
312. ## <a id="r8-abstract-class"></a> `JsonIOException`: 'Abstract classes can't be instantiated!' (R8)
313. 
314. **Symptom:** A `JsonIOException` with the message 'Abstract classes can't be instantiated!' is thrown; the class mentioned in the exception message is not actually `abstract` in your source code, and you are using the code shrinking tool R8 (Android app builds normally have this configured by default).
315. 
316. **Reason:** The code shrinking tool R8 performs optimizations where it removes the no-args constructor from a class and makes the class `abstract`. Due to this Gson cannot create an instance of the class.
317. 
318. **Solution:** Make sure the class has a no-args constructor, then adjust your R8 configuration file to keep the constructor of the class. For example:
319. 
320. ```
321. # Keep the no-args constructor of the deserialized class
322. -keepclassmembers class com.example.MyClass {
323.   <init>();
324. }
325. ```
326. 
327. For Android you can add this rule to the `proguard-rules.pro` file, see also the [Android documentation](https://developer.android.com/build/shrink-code#keep-code). In case the class name in the exception message is obfuscated, see the Android documentation about [retracing](https://developer.android.com/build/shrink-code#retracing).
328. 
329. Note: If the class which you are trying to deserialize is actually abstract, then this exception is probably unrelated to R8 and you will have to implement a custom [`InstanceCreator`](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/InstanceCreator.html) or [`TypeAdapter`](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html) which creates an instance of a non-abstract subclass of the class.

3. Example Android project showing how to properly configure [ProGuard](https://www.guardsquare.com/proguard).
4. ProGuard is a tool for 'shrinking' and obfuscating compiled classes. It can rename methods and fields,
5. or remove them if they appear to be unused. This can cause issues for Gson which uses Java reflection to
6. access the fields of a class. It is necessary to configure ProGuard to make sure that Gson works correctly.
7. 
8. Also have a look at the [ProGuard manual](https://www.guardsquare.com/manual/configuration/usage#keepoverview)
9. and the [ProGuard Gson examples](https://www.guardsquare.com/manual/configuration/examples#gson) for more
10. details on how ProGuard can be configured.
11. 
12. The R8 code shrinker uses the same rule format as ProGuard, but there are differences between these two
13. tools. Have a look at R8's Compatibility FAQ, and especially at the [Gson section](https://r8.googlesource.com/r8/+/refs/heads/main/compatibility-faq.md#gson).
14. 
15. Note that newer Gson versions apply some of the rules shown in `proguard.cfg` automatically by default,
16. see the file [`gson/META-INF/proguard/gson.pro`](/gson/src/main/resources/META-INF/proguard/gson.pro) for
17. the Gson version you are using.

--- END AGGREGATED CONTEXT ---

Analyze if the current context is sufficient to complete the user query by considering:
1. Do you understand the full scope and requirements of the user query?
2. Do you have access to all relevant code that needs to be examined or modified?
3. Are all critical dependencies and their interfaces visible?
4. Is there enough context about the system architecture and design patterns?
5. Do you have access to relevant documentation or tests if needed?

Only request additional context if essential information is missing. Ensure you're not requesting:
- Information already provided in previous queries
- Nice-to-have but non-essential details
- Implementation details that aren't relevant to the current task

If additional context is needed:
- Be specific about what you're looking for
- Consider both code and documentation that might be relevant

IMPORTANT:
- Try to avoid asking for the SAME or very similar information as previous queries, because these queries have already been asked and satisfied.

This guide describes how to troubleshoot common issues when using Gson.\n4. \n5. <!-- The \'<a id="..."></a>\' anchors below are used to create stable links; don\'t remove or rename them -->\n6. <!-- Use only lowercase IDs, GitHub seems to not support uppercase IDs, see also https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/50962 -->\n7. \n8. ## <a id="class-cast-exception"></a> `ClassCastException` when using deserialized object\n9. \n10. **Symptom:** `ClassCastException` is thrown when accessing an object deserialized by Gson\n11. \n12. **Reason:** Your code is most likely not type-safe\n13. \n14. **Solution:** Make sure your code adheres to the following:\n15. \n16. - Avoid raw types: Instead of calling `fromJson(..., List.class)`, create for example a `TypeToken<List<MyClass>>`.\n17.   See the [user guide](UserGuide.md#collections-examples) for more information.\n18. - When using `TypeToken` prefer the `Gson.fromJson` overloads with `TypeToken` parameter such as [`fromJson(Reader, TypeToken)`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/Gson.html#fromJson(java.io.Reader,com.google.gson.reflect.TypeToken)).\n19.   The overloads with `Type` parameter do not provide any type-safety guarantees.\n20. - When using `TypeToken` make sure you don\'t capture a type variable. For example avoid something like `new TypeToken<List<T>>()` (where `T` is a type variable). Due to Java type erasure the actual type of `T` is not available at runtime. Refactor your code to pass around `TypeToken` instances or use [`TypeToken.getParameterized(...)`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/reflect/TypeToken.html#getParameterized(java.lang.reflect.Type,java.lang.reflect.Type...)), for example `TypeToken.getParameterized(List.class, elementClass)`.\n21. \n22. ## <a id="reflection-inaccessible"></a> `InaccessibleObjectException`: \'module ... does not "opens ..." to unnamed module\'\n23. \n24. **Symptom:** An exception with a message in the form \'module ... does not "opens ..." to unnamed module\' is thrown\n25. \n26. **Reason:** You use Gson by accident to access internal fields of third-party classes\n27. \n28. **Solution:** Write custom Gson [`TypeAdapter`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html) implementations for the affected classes or change the type of your data. If this occurs for a field in one of your classes which you did not actually want to serialize or deserialize in the first place, you can exclude that field, see the [user guide](UserGuide.md#excluding-fields-from-serialization-and-deserialization).\n29. \n30. **Explanation:**\n31. \n32. When no built-in adapter for a type exists and no custom adapter has been registered, Gson falls back to using reflection to access the fields of a class (including `private` ones). Most likely you are seeing this error because you (by accident) rely on the reflection-based adapter for third-party classes. That should be avoided because you make yourself dependent on the implementation details of these classes which could change at any point. For the JDK it is also not possible anymore to access internal fields using reflection starting with JDK 17, see [JEP 403](https://openjdk.org/jeps/403).\n33. \n34. If you want to prevent using reflection on third-party classes in the future you can write your own [`ReflectionAccessFilter`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/ReflectionAccessFilter.html) or use one of the predefined ones, such as `ReflectionAccessFilter.BLOCK_ALL_PLATFORM`.\n35. \n36. ## <a id="reflection-inaccessible-to-module-gson"></a> `InaccessibleObjectException`: \'module ... does not "opens ..." to module com.google.gson\'\n37. \n38. **Symptom:** An exception with a message in the form \'module ... does not "opens ..." to module com.google.gson\' is thrown\n39. \n40. **Reason:**\n41. \n42. - If the reported package is your own package then you have not configured the module declaration of your project to allow Gson to use reflection on your classes.\n43. - If the reported package is from a third party library or the JDK see [this troubleshooting point](#inaccessibleobjectexception-module--does-not-opens--to-unnamed-module).\n44. \n45. **Solution:** Make sure the `module-info.java` file of your project allows Gson to use reflection on your classes, for example:\n46. \n47. ```java\n48. module mymodule {\n49.     requires com.google.gson;\n50. \n51.     opens mypackage to com.google.gson;\n52. }\n53. ```\n54. \n55. Or in case this occurs for a field in one of your classes which you did not actually want to serialize or deserialize in the first place, you can exclude that field, see the [user guide](UserGuide.md#excluding-fields-from-serialization-and-deserialization).\n56. \n57. ## <a id="android-app-random-names"></a> Android app not working in Release mode; random property names\n58. \n59. **Symptom:** Your Android app is working fine in Debug mode but fails in Release mode and the JSON properties have seemingly random names such as `a`, `b`, ...\n60. \n61. **Reason:** You probably have not configured ProGuard / R8 correctly\n62. \n63. **Solution:** Make sure you have configured ProGuard / R8 correctly to preserve the names of your fields. See the [Android example](examples/android-proguard-example/README.md) for more information.\n64. \n65. ## <a id="android-app-broken-after-app-update"></a> Android app unable to parse JSON after app update\n66. \n67. **Symptom:** You released a new version of your Android app and it fails to parse JSON data created by the previous version of your app\n68. \n69. **Reason:** You probably have not configured ProGuard / R8 correctly; probably the fields names are being obfuscated and their naming changed between the versions of your app\n70. \n71. **Solution:** Make sure you have configured ProGuard / R8 correctly to preserve the names of your fields. See the [Android example](examples/android-proguard-example/README.md) for more information.\n72. \n73. If you want to preserve backward compatibility for you app you can use [`@SerializedName`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/annotations/SerializedName.html) on the fields to specify the obfuscated name as alternate, for example: `@SerializedName(value = "myprop", alternate = "a")`\n74. \n75. Normally ProGuard and R8 produce a mapping file, this makes it easier to find out the obfuscated field names instead of having to find them out through trial and error or other means. See the [Android Studio user guide](https://developer.android.com/studio/build/shrink-code.html#retracing) for more information.\n76. \n77. ## <a id="default-field-values-missing"></a> Default field values not present after deserialization\n78. \n79. **Symptom:** You have assign default values to fields but after deserialization the fields have their standard value (such as `null` or `0`)\n80. \n81. **Reason:** Gson cannot invoke the constructor of your class and falls back to JDK `Unsafe` (or similar means)\n82. \n83. **Solution:** Make sure that the class:\n84. \n85. - is `static` (explicitly or implicitly when it is a top-level class)\n86. - has a no-args constructor\n87. \n88. Otherwise Gson will by default try to use JDK `Unsafe` or similar means to create an instance of your class without invoking the constructor and without running any initializers. You can also disable that behavior through [`GsonBuilder.disableJdkUnsafe()`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.html#disableJdkUnsafe()) to notice such issues early on.\n89. \n90. ## <a id="anonymous-local-null"></a> `null` values for anonymous and local classes\n91. \n92. **Symptom:** Objects of a class are always serialized as JSON `null` / always deserialized as Java `null`\n93. \n94. **Reason:** The class you are serializing or deserializing is an anonymous or a local class (or you have specified a custom `ExclusionStrategy`)\n95. \n96. **Solution:** Convert the class to a `static` nested class. If the class is already `static` make sure you have not specified a Gson `ExclusionStrategy` which might exclude the class.\n97. \n98. Notes:\n99. \n100. - "double brace-initialization" also creates anonymous classes\n101. - Local record classes (feature added in Java 16) are supported by Gson and are not affected by this\n102. \n103. ## <a id="map-key-wrong-json"></a> Map keys having unexpected format in JSON\n104. \n105. **Symptom:** JSON output for `Map` keys is unexpected / cannot be deserialized again\n106. \n107. **Reason:** The `Map` key type is \'complex\' and you have not configured the `GsonBuilder` properly\n108. \n109. **Solution:** Use [`GsonBuilder.enableComplexMapKeySerialization()`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.html#enableComplexMapKeySerialization()). See also the [user guide](UserGuide.md#maps-examples) for more information.\n110. \n111. ## <a id="malformed-json"></a> Parsing JSON fails with `MalformedJsonException`\n112. \n113. **Symptom:** JSON parsing fails with `MalformedJsonException`\n114. \n115. **Reason:** The JSON data is actually malformed\n116. \n117. **Solution:** During debugging, log the JSON data right before calling Gson methods or set a breakpoint to inspect the data and make sure it has the expected format. Sometimes APIs might return HTML error pages (instead of JSON data) when reaching rate limits or when other errors occur. Also read the location information of the `MalformedJsonException` exception message, it indicates where exactly in the document the malformed data was detected, including the [JSONPath](https://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/).\n118. \n119. For example, let\'s assume you want to deserialize the following JSON data:\n120. \n121. ```json\n122. {\n123.   "languages": [\n124.     "English",\n125.     "French",\n126.   ]\n127. }\n128. ```\n129. \n130. This will fail with an exception similar to this one: `MalformedJsonException: Use JsonReader.setLenient(true) to accept malformed JSON at line 5 column 4 path $.languages[2]`  \n131. The problem here is the trailing comma (`,`) after `"French"`, trailing commas are not allowed by the JSON specification. The location information "line 5 column 4" points to the `]` in the JSON data (with some slight inaccuracies) because Gson expected another value after `,` instead of the closing `]`. The JSONPath `$.languages[2]` in the exception message also points there: `$.` refers to the root object, `languages` refers to its member of that name and `[2]` refers to the (missing) third value in the JSON array value of that member (numbering starts at 0, so it is `[2]` instead of `[3]`).  \n132. The proper solution here is to fix the malformed JSON data.\n133. \n134. To spot syntax errors in the JSON data easily you can open it in an editor with support for JSON, for example Visual Studio Code. It will highlight within the JSON data the error location and show why the JSON data is considered invalid.\n135. \n136. ## <a id="number-parsed-as-double"></a> Integral JSON number is parsed as `double`\n137. \n138. **Symptom:** JSON data contains an integral number such as `45` but Gson returns it as `double`\n139. \n140. **Reason:** When parsing a JSON number as `Object`, Gson will by default create always return a `double`\n141. \n142. **Solution:** Use [`GsonBuilder.setObjectToNumberStrategy`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.html#setObjectToNumberStrategy(com.google.gson.ToNumberStrategy)) to specify what type of number should be returned\n143. \n144. ## <a id="default-lenient"></a> Malformed JSON not rejected\n145. \n146. **Symptom:** Gson parses malformed JSON without throwing any exceptions\n147. \n148. **Reason:** Due to legacy reasons Gson performs parsing by default in lenient mode\n149. \n150. **Solution:** See [`Gson` class documentation](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/Gson.html#default-lenient) section "Lenient JSON handling"\n151. \n152. Note: Even in non-lenient mode Gson deviates slightly from the JSON specification, see [`JsonReader.setLenient`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/stream/JsonReader.html#setLenient(boolean)) for more details.\n153. \n154. ## <a id="unexpected-json-structure"></a> `IllegalStateException`: "Expected ... but was ..."\n155. \n156. **Symptom:** An `IllegalStateException` with a message in the form "Expected ... but was ..." is thrown\n157. \n158. **Reason:** The JSON data does not have the correct format\n159. \n160. **Solution:** Make sure that your classes correctly model the JSON data. Also during debugging log the JSON data right before calling Gson methods or set a breakpoint to inspect the data and make sure it has the expected format. Read the location information of the exception message, it indicates where exactly in the document the error occurred, including the [JSONPath](https://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/).\n161. \n162. For example, let\'s assume you have the following Java class:\n163. \n164. ```java\n165. class WebPage {\n166.     String languages;\n167. }\n168. ```\n169. \n170. And you want to deserialize the following JSON data:\n171. \n172. ```json\n173. {\n174.   "languages": ["English", "French"]\n175. }\n176. ```\n177. \n178. This will fail with an exception similar to this one: `IllegalStateException: Expected a string but was BEGIN_ARRAY at line 2 column 17 path $.languages`  \n179. This means Gson expected a JSON string value but found the beginning of a JSON array (`[`). The location information "line 2 column 17" points to the `[` in the JSON data (with some slight inaccuracies), so does the JSONPath `$.languages` in the exception message. It refers to the `languages` member of the root object (`$.`).  \n180. The solution here is to change in the `WebPage` class the field `String languages` to `List<String> languages`.\n181. \n182. ## <a id="adapter-not-null-safe"></a> `IllegalStateException`: "Expected ... but was NULL"\n183. \n184. **Symptom:** An `IllegalStateException` with a message in the form "Expected ... but was NULL" is thrown\n185. \n186. **Reason:**\n187. \n188. - A built-in adapter does not support JSON null values\n189. - You have written a custom `TypeAdapter` which does not properly handle JSON null values\n190. \n191. **Solution:** If this occurs for a custom adapter you wrote, add code similar to the following at the beginning of its `read` method:\n192. \n193. ```java\n194. @Override\n195. public MyClass read(JsonReader in) throws IOException {\n196.     if (in.peek() == JsonToken.NULL) {\n197.         in.nextNull();\n198.         return null;\n199.     }\n200. \n201.     ...\n202. }\n203. ```\n204. \n205. Alternatively you can call [`nullSafe()`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html#nullSafe()) on the adapter instance you created.\n206. \n207. ## <a id="serialize-nulls"></a> Properties missing in JSON\n208. \n209. **Symptom:** Properties are missing in the JSON output\n210. \n211. **Reason:** Gson by default omits JSON null from the output (or: ProGuard / R8 is not configured correctly and removed unused fields)\n212. \n213. **Solution:** Use [`GsonBuilder.serializeNulls()`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.html#serializeNulls())\n214. \n215. Note: Gson does not support anonymous and local classes and will serialize them as JSON null, see the [related troubleshooting point](#null-values-for-anonymous-and-local-classes).\n216. \n217. ## <a id="android-internal-fields"></a> JSON output changes for newer Android versions\n218. \n219. **Symptom:** The JSON output differs when running on newer Android versions\n220. \n221. **Reason:** You use Gson by accident to access internal fields of Android classes\n222. \n223. **Solution:** Write custom Gson [`TypeAdapter`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html) implementations for the affected classes or change the type of your data\n224. \n225. **Explanation:**\n226. \n227. When no built-in adapter for a type exists and no custom adapter has been registered, Gson falls back to using reflection to access the fields of a class (including `private` ones). Most likely you are experiencing this issue because you (by accident) rely on the reflection-based adapter for Android classes. That should be avoided because you make yourself dependent on the implementation details of these classes which could change at any point.\n228. \n229. If you want to prevent using reflection on third-party classes in the future you can write your own [`ReflectionAccessFilter`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/ReflectionAccessFilter.html) or use one of the predefined ones, such as `ReflectionAccessFilter.BLOCK_ALL_PLATFORM`.\n230. \n231. ## <a id="json-static-fields"></a> JSON output contains values of `static` fields\n232. \n233. **Symptom:** The JSON output contains values of `static` fields\n234. \n235. **Reason:** You used `GsonBuilder.excludeFieldsWithModifiers` to overwrite the default excluded modifiers\n236. \n237. **Solution:** When calling `GsonBuilder.excludeFieldsWithModifiers` you overwrite the default excluded modifiers. Therefore, you have to explicitly exclude `static` fields if desired. This can be done by adding `Modifier.STATIC` as additional argument.\n238. \n239. ## <a id="no-such-method-error"></a> `NoSuchMethodError` when calling Gson methods\n240. \n241. **Symptom:** A `java.lang.NoSuchMethodError` is thrown when trying to call certain Gson methods\n242. \n243. **Reason:**\n244. \n245. - You have multiple versions of Gson on your classpath\n246. - Or, the Gson version you compiled against is different from the one on your classpath\n247. - Or, you are using a code shrinking tool such as ProGuard or R8 which removed methods from Gson\n248. \n249. **Solution:** First disable any code shrinking tools such as ProGuard or R8 and check if the issue persists. If not, you have to tweak the configuration of that tool to not modify Gson classes. Otherwise verify that the Gson JAR on your classpath is the same you are compiling against, and that there is only one Gson JAR on your classpath. See [this Stack Overflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/q/227486) to find out where a class is loaded from. For example, for debugging you could include the following code:\n250. \n251. ```java\n252. System.out.println(Gson.class.getProtectionDomain().getCodeSource().getLocation());\n253. ```\n254. \n255. If that fails with a `NullPointerException` you have to try one of the other ways to find out where a class is loaded from.\n256. \n257. ## <a id="duplicate-fields"></a> `IllegalArgumentException`: \'Class ... declares multiple JSON fields named \'...\'\'\n258. \n259. **Symptom:** An exception with the message \'Class ... declares multiple JSON fields named \'...\'\' is thrown\n260. \n261. **Reason:**\n262. \n263. - The name you have specified with a [`@SerializedName`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/annotations/SerializedName.html) annotation for a field collides with the name of another field\n264. - The [`FieldNamingStrategy`](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/FieldNamingStrategy.html) you have specified produces conflicting field names\n265. - A field of your class has the same name as the field of a superclass\n266. \n267. Gson prevents multiple fields with the same name because during deserialization it would be ambiguous for which field the JSON data should be deserialized. For serialization it would cause the same field to appear multiple times in JSON. While the JSON specification permits this, it is likely that the application parsing the JSON data will not handle it correctly.\n268. \n269. **Solution:** First identify the fields with conflicting names based on the exception message. Then decide if you want to rename one of them using the [`@SerializedName`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/annotations/SerializedName.html) annotation, or if you want to [exclude](UserGuide.md#excluding-fields-from-serialization-and-deserialization) one of them. When excluding one of the fields you have to include it for both serialization and deserialization (even if your application only performs one of these actions) because the duplicate field check cannot differentiate between these actions.\n270. \n271. ## <a id="java-lang-class-unsupported"></a> `UnsupportedOperationException` when serializing or deserializing `java.lang.Class`\n272. \n273. **Symptom:** An `UnsupportedOperationException` is thrown when trying to serialize or deserialize `java.lang.Class`\n274. \n275. **Reason:** Gson intentionally does not permit serializing and deserializing `java.lang.Class` for security reasons. Otherwise a malicious user could make your application load an arbitrary class from the classpath and, depending on what your application does with the `Class`, in the worst case perform a remote code execution attack.\n276. \n277. **Solution:** First check if you really need to serialize or deserialize a `Class`. Often it is possible to use string aliases and then map them to the known `Class`; you could write a custom [`TypeAdapter`](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html) to do this. If the `Class` values are not known in advance, try to introduce a common base class or interface for all these classes and then verify that the deserialized class is a subclass. For example assuming the base class is called `MyBaseClass`, your custom `TypeAdapter` should load the class like this:\n278. \n279. ```java\n280. Class.forName(jsonString, false, getClass().getClassLoader()).asSubclass(MyBaseClass.class)\n281. ```\n282. \n283. This will not initialize arbitrary classes, and it will throw a `ClassCastException` if the loaded class is not the same as or a subclass of `MyBaseClass`.\n284. \n285. ## <a id="type-token-raw"></a> `IllegalStateException`: \'TypeToken must be created with a type argument\' <br> `RuntimeException`: \'Missing type parameter\'\n286. \n287. **Symptom:** An `IllegalStateException` with the message \'TypeToken must be created with a type argument\' is thrown.  \n288. For older Gson versions a `RuntimeException` with message \'Missing type parameter\' is thrown.\n289. \n290. **Reason:**\n291. \n292. - You created a `TypeToken` without type argument, for example `new TypeToken() {}` (note the missing `<...>`). You always have to provide the type argument, for example like this: `new TypeToken<List<String>>() {}`. Normally the compiler will also emit a \'raw types\' warning when you forget the `<...>`.\n293. - You are using a code shrinking tool such as ProGuard or R8 (Android app builds normally have this enabled by default) but have not configured it correctly for usage with Gson.\n294. \n295. **Solution:** When you are using a code shrinking tool such as ProGuard or R8 you have to adjust your configuration to include the following rules:\n296. \n297. ```\n298. # Keep generic signatures; needed for correct type resolution\n299. -keepattributes Signature\n300. \n301. # Keep class TypeToken (respectively its generic signature)\n302. -keep class com.google.gson.reflect.TypeToken { *; }\n303. \n304. # Keep any (anonymous) classes extending TypeToken\n305. -keep class * extends com.google.gson.reflect.TypeToken\n306. ```\n307. \n308. See also the [Android example](examples/android-proguard-example/README.md) for more information.\n309. \n310. Note: For newer Gson versions these rules might be applied automatically; make sure you are using the latest Gson version and the latest version of the code shrinking tool.\n311. \n312. ## <a id="r8-abstract-class"></a> `JsonIOException`: \'Abstract classes can\'t be instantiated!\' (R8)\n313. \n314. **Symptom:** A `JsonIOException` with the message \'Abstract classes can\'t be instantiated!\' is thrown; the class mentioned in the exception message is not actually `abstract` in your source code, and you are using the code shrinking tool R8 (Android app builds normally have this configured by default).\n315. \n316. **Reason:** The code shrinking tool R8 performs optimizations where it removes the no-args constructor from a class and makes the class `abstract`. Due to this Gson cannot create an instance of the class.\n317. \n318. **Solution:** Make sure the class has a no-args constructor, then adjust your R8 configuration file to keep the constructor of the class. For example:\n319. \n320. ```\n321. # Keep the no-args constructor of the deserialized class\n322. -keepclassmembers class com.example.MyClass {\n323.   <init>();\n324. }\n325. ```\n326. \n327. For Android you can add this rule to the `proguard-rules.pro` file, see also the [Android documentation](https://developer.android.com/build/shrink-code#keep-code). In case the class name in the exception message is obfuscated, see the Android documentation about [retracing](https://developer.android.com/build/shrink-code#retracing).\n328. \n329. Note: If the class which you are trying to deserialize is actually abstract, then this exception is probably unrelated to R8 and you will have to implement a custom [`InstanceCreator`](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/InstanceCreator.html) or [`TypeAdapter`](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html) which creates an instance of a non-abstract subclass of the class.', start_line_number=1, end_line_number=329), Context(relative_path='examples/android-proguard-example/README.md', content="1. # android-proguard-example\n2. \n3. Example Android project showing how to properly configure [ProGuard](https://www.guardsquare.com/proguard).\n4. ProGuard is a tool for 'shrinking' and obfuscating compiled classes. It can rename methods and fields,\n5. or remove them if they appear to be unused. This can cause issues for Gson which uses Java reflection to\n6. access the fields of a class. It is necessary to configure ProGuard to make sure that Gson works correctly.\n7. \n8. Also have a look at the [ProGuard manual](https://www.guardsquare.com/manual/configuration/usage#keepoverview)\n9. and the [ProGuard Gson examples](https://www.guardsquare.com/manual/configuration/examples#gson) for more\n10. details on how ProGuard can be configured.\n11. \n12. The R8 code shrinker uses the same rule format as ProGuard, but there are differences between these two\n13. tools. Have a look at R8's Compatibility FAQ, and especially at the [Gson section](https://r8.googlesource.com/r8/+/refs/heads/main/compatibility-faq.md#gson).\n14. \n15.

Considerations:\n- Identify potential impacts on existing functionality\n- Consider backward compatibility\n- Note any dependencies or prerequisites\n\nDo NOT provide actual code snippets or diffs. Focus on describing what needs to be implemented.\n\nHere are the details for analysis:\n\nIssue title:\nImprove default ProGuard / R8 rules and Troubleshooting Guide\n\nIssue description: \n# Problem solved by the feature\nImprove the default ProGuard / R8 rules in `META-INF/proguard/gson.pro` added by #2397, and the Troubleshooting Guide.\n\n# Feature description\nI was testing the new default rules with an Android app and Kotlin classes, and there might be the following areas to improve.\n\n### Troubleshooting Guide: `JsonIOException`: \'Abstract classes can\'t be instantiated!\' (R8)\n\nThe Troubleshooting Guide currently suggests the following:\n```\n# Keep the no-args constructor of the deserialized class\n-keepclassmembers class com.example.MyClass {\n  <init>();\n}\n```\n\nThis means only the no-args constructor is kept, but not any other constructors. However, especially for Kotlin I assume it is common that classes don\'t have a no-args constructor because you might declare properties and the primary constructor at once, e.g. `class MyClass(val s: String)` (see [Kotlin documentation](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/classes.html#constructors)). Not sure though if using that is a good idea in combination with Gson because it then requires JDK Unsafe to create instances, but that is a different topic.\n\nSo there are two questions:\n- Should the Troubleshooting Guide rather recommend `<init>(...);` (all constructors), so that the users don\'t experience issues with R8 anymore (but implicitly depend on JDK Unsafe; using `GsonBuilder.disableJdkUnsafe()` would cause Gson to fail with a different exception)\n- Should the Troubleshooting Guide recommend `-keep` instead of `-keepclassmembers`. In case the `<init>` rule for the class properly matches a constructor it might not matter. But in case `<init>();` is used, but a no-args constructor does not exist, then `-keep` seems to at least have the side-effect that R8 does not make the class abstract (and then using JDK Unsafe an instance can be created).\n\n### Troubleshooting Guide: Recommend `@Keep` for Android\nInstead of configuring ProGuard / R8 rules, it might be easier for Android developers to use `@Keep` on the corresponding class or constructor, see https://developer.android.com/studio/write/annotations#keep\n\n### Preventing R8 from making classes abstract / removing no-args constructor\n\nIt would be good if we could adjust the default rules to avoid the "Abstract classes can\'t be instantiated!" exception (for most cases) in the first place.\n\nThere is probably no general way to detect if a class might be used with Gson, but the most reliable variant might be to keep the constructor if any of the Gson annotations is used by a class.\n\nThis can probably be achieved with an [`-if` rule](https://www.guardsquare.com/manual/configuration/usage#if) (see also [answers to this Stack Overflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/q/63162818)). For example:\n```\n# If class has fields with `@SerializedName` annotation keep its constructors\n-if class * {\n  @com.google.gson.annotations.SerializedName <fields>;\n}\n-keep class <1> {\n  <init>(...);\n}\n```\n(duplicated for all Gson annotations)\n\nBut it looks like this is not enough, maybe because there is no `-keep` (or `-keepclasseswithmembers`) rule for the class in the first place so `-if` somehow has no effect? You additionally need the following (duplicated for all Gson annotations probably):\n```\n-keepclasseswithmembers class * {\n  @com.google.gson.annotations.SerializedName <fields>;\n}\n```\nOnly then the class is not made abstract and the constructor is properly kept...\n\n(As side note: Having only the `-keepclasseswithmembers ... { @SerializedName }` above, but not the `-if ... -keep` seems to prevent R8 from making the class abstract, but still removes all constructors, so users would be dependent on JDK Unsafe then.)\n\nOr similar to https://github.com/google/gson/issues/2379#issuecomment-1564517629 maybe the following would work as well:\n```\n-keepclasseswithmembers class * {\n  <init>(...);\n  @com.google.gson.annotations.SerializedName <fields>;\n}\n```\nThere is however probably no need for the `-if` rule shown in the original comment, unless that has some special effect, see https://github.com/google/gson/pull/2397#issuecomment-1575236086.\n\n### R8 makes class abstract but still keeps constructors\n\nIt also looks like the Android app build creates (for some reason) additional constructors / keeps constructors even when the class is made abstract. Due to this, the Troubleshooting Guide URLs are unfortunately not included in the exception messages (they are only added at the moment when there are no constructors).\nNot really sure why these constructors exist in the first place and are kept even when the class is made abstract. In the R8 integration test of Gson this behavior was not seen.\n\nMaybe we should remove the `getDeclaredConstructors().length == 0` check if the class is abstract and always refer to the Troubleshooting Guide. The guide would have to be adjusted then though to also properly cover the case where the class was indeed abstract in the source code.\n\n---\n\nAny additional feedback is highly appreciated!\n\n\nIssue comments:\n\n\nFeature Context:\nFile: Troubleshooting.md\nLine number range: 1 - 329\nContent:\n1. # Troubleshooting Guide\n2. \n3. This guide describes how to troubleshoot common issues when using Gson.\n4. \n5. <!-- The \'<a id="..."></a>\' anchors below are used to create stable links; don\'t remove or rename them -->\n6. <!-- Use only lowercase IDs, GitHub seems to not support uppercase IDs, see also https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/50962 -->\n7. \n8. ## <a id="class-cast-exception"></a> `ClassCastException` when using deserialized object\n9. \n10. **Symptom:** `ClassCastException` is thrown when accessing an object deserialized by Gson\n11. \n12. **Reason:** Your code is most likely not type-safe\n13. \n14. **Solution:** Make sure your code adheres to the following:\n15. \n16. - Avoid raw types: Instead of calling `fromJson(..., List.class)`, create for example a `TypeToken<List<MyClass>>`.\n17.   See the [user guide](UserGuide.md#collections-examples) for more information.\n18. - When using `TypeToken` prefer the `Gson.fromJson` overloads with `TypeToken` parameter such as [`fromJson(Reader, TypeToken)`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/Gson.html#fromJson(java.io.Reader,com.google.gson.reflect.TypeToken)).\n19.   The overloads with `Type` parameter do not provide any type-safety guarantees.\n20. - When using `TypeToken` make sure you don\'t capture a type variable. For example avoid something like `new TypeToken<List<T>>()` (where `T` is a type variable). Due to Java type erasure the actual type of `T` is not available at runtime. Refactor your code to pass around `TypeToken` instances or use [`TypeToken.getParameterized(...)`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/reflect/TypeToken.html#getParameterized(java.lang.reflect.Type,java.lang.reflect.Type...)), for example `TypeToken.getParameterized(List.class, elementClass)`.\n21. \n22. ## <a id="reflection-inaccessible"></a> `InaccessibleObjectException`: \'module ... does not "opens ..." to unnamed module\'\n23. \n24. **Symptom:** An exception with a message in the form \'module ... does not "opens ..." to unnamed module\' is thrown\n25. \n26. **Reason:** You use Gson by accident to access internal fields of third-party classes\n27. \n28. **Solution:** Write custom Gson [`TypeAdapter`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html) implementations for the affected classes or change the type of your data. If this occurs for a field in one of your classes which you did not actually want to serialize or deserialize in the first place, you can exclude that field, see the [user guide](UserGuide.md#excluding-fields-from-serialization-and-deserialization).\n29. \n30. **Explanation:**\n31. \n32. When no built-in adapter for a type exists and no custom adapter has been registered, Gson falls back to using reflection to access the fields of a class (including `private` ones). Most likely you are seeing this error because you (by accident) rely on the reflection-based adapter for third-party classes. That should be avoided because you make yourself dependent on the implementation details of these classes which could change at any point. For the JDK it is also not possible anymore to access internal fields using reflection starting with JDK 17, see [JEP 403](https://openjdk.org/jeps/403).\n33. \n34. If you want to prevent using reflection on third-party classes in the future you can write your own [`ReflectionAccessFilter`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/ReflectionAccessFilter.html) or use one of the predefined ones, such as `ReflectionAccessFilter.BLOCK_ALL_PLATFORM`.\n35. \n36. ## <a id="reflection-inaccessible-to-module-gson"></a> `InaccessibleObjectException`: \'module ... does not "opens ..." to module com.google.gson\'\n37. \n38. **Symptom:** An exception with a message in the form \'module ... does not "opens ..." to module com.google.gson\' is thrown\n39. \n40. **Reason:**\n41. \n42. - If the reported package is your own package then you have not configured the module declaration of your project to allow Gson to use reflection on your classes.\n43. - If the reported package is from a third party library or the JDK see [this troubleshooting point](#inaccessibleobjectexception-module--does-not-opens--to-unnamed-module).\n44. \n45. **Solution:** Make sure the `module-info.java` file of your project allows Gson to use reflection on your classes, for example:\n46. \n47. ```java\n48. module mymodule {\n49.     requires com.google.gson;\n50. \n51.     opens mypackage to com.google.gson;\n52. }\n53. ```\n54. \n55. Or in case this occurs for a field in one of your classes which you did not actually want to serialize or deserialize in the first place, you can exclude that field, see the [user guide](UserGuide.md#excluding-fields-from-serialization-and-deserialization).\n56. \n57. ## <a id="android-app-random-names"></a> Android app not working in Release mode; random property names\n58. \n59. **Symptom:** Your Android app is working fine in Debug mode but fails in Release mode and the JSON properties have seemingly random names such as `a`, `b`, ...\n60. \n61. **Reason:** You probably have not configured ProGuard / R8 correctly\n62. \n63. **Solution:** Make sure you have configured ProGuard / R8 correctly to preserve the names of your fields. See the [Android example](examples/android-proguard-example/README.md) for more information.\n64. \n65. ## <a id="android-app-broken-after-app-update"></a> Android app unable to parse JSON after app update\n66. \n67. **Symptom:** You released a new version of your Android app and it fails to parse JSON data created by the previous version of your app\n68. \n69. **Reason:** You probably have not configured ProGuard / R8 correctly; probably the fields names are being obfuscated and their naming changed between the versions of your app\n70. \n71. **Solution:** Make sure you have configured ProGuard / R8 correctly to preserve the names of your fields. See the [Android example](examples/android-proguard-example/README.md) for more information.\n72. \n73. If you want to preserve backward compatibility for you app you can use [`@SerializedName`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/annotations/SerializedName.html) on the fields to specify the obfuscated name as alternate, for example: `@SerializedName(value = "myprop", alternate = "a")`\n74. \n75. Normally ProGuard and R8 produce a mapping file, this makes it easier to find out the obfuscated field names instead of having to find them out through trial and error or other means. See the [Android Studio user guide](https://developer.android.com/studio/build/shrink-code.html#retracing) for more information.\n76. \n77. ## <a id="default-field-values-missing"></a> Default field values not present after deserialization\n78. \n79. **Symptom:** You have assign default values to fields but after deserialization the fields have their standard value (such as `null` or `0`)\n80. \n81. **Reason:** Gson cannot invoke the constructor of your class and falls back to JDK `Unsafe` (or similar means)\n82. \n83. **Solution:** Make sure that the class:\n84. \n85. - is `static` (explicitly or implicitly when it is a top-level class)\n86. - has a no-args constructor\n87. \n88. Otherwise Gson will by default try to use JDK `Unsafe` or similar means to create an instance of your class without invoking the constructor and without running any initializers. You can also disable that behavior through [`GsonBuilder.disableJdkUnsafe()`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.html#disableJdkUnsafe()) to notice such issues early on.\n89. \n90. ## <a id="anonymous-local-null"></a> `null` values for anonymous and local classes\n91. \n92. **Symptom:** Objects of a class are always serialized as JSON `null` / always deserialized as Java `null`\n93. \n94. **Reason:** The class you are serializing or deserializing is an anonymous or a local class (or you have specified a custom `ExclusionStrategy`)\n95. \n96. **Solution:** Convert the class to a `static` nested class. If the class is already `static` make sure you have not specified a Gson `ExclusionStrategy` which might exclude the class.\n97. \n98. Notes:\n99. \n100. - "double brace-initialization" also creates anonymous classes\n101. - Local record classes (feature added in Java 16) are supported by Gson and are not affected by this\n102. \n103. ## <a id="map-key-wrong-json"></a> Map keys having unexpected format in JSON\n104. \n105. **Symptom:** JSON output for `Map` keys is unexpected / cannot be deserialized again\n106. \n107. **Reason:** The `Map` key type is \'complex\' and you have not configured the `GsonBuilder` properly\n108. \n109. **Solution:** Use [`GsonBuilder.enableComplexMapKeySerialization()`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.html#enableComplexMapKeySerialization()). See also the [user guide](UserGuide.md#maps-examples) for more information.\n110. \n111. ## <a id="malformed-json"></a> Parsing JSON fails with `MalformedJsonException`\n112. \n113. **Symptom:** JSON parsing fails with `MalformedJsonException`\n114. \n115. **Reason:** The JSON data is actually malformed\n116. \n117. **Solution:** During debugging, log the JSON data right before calling Gson methods or set a breakpoint to inspect the data and make sure it has the expected format. Sometimes APIs might return HTML error pages (instead of JSON data) when reaching rate limits or when other errors occur. Also read the location information of the `MalformedJsonException` exception message, it indicates where exactly in the document the malformed data was detected, including the [JSONPath](https://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/).\n118. \n119. For example, let\'s assume you want to deserialize the following JSON data:\n120. \n121. ```json\n122. {\n123.   "languages": [\n124.     "English",\n125.     "French",\n126.   ]\n127. }\n128. ```\n129. \n130. This will fail with an exception similar to this one: `MalformedJsonException: Use JsonReader.setLenient(true) to accept malformed JSON at line 5 column 4 path $.languages[2]`  \n131. The problem here is the trailing comma (`,`) after `"French"`, trailing commas are not allowed by the JSON specification. The location information "line 5 column 4" points to the `]` in the JSON data (with some slight inaccuracies) because Gson expected another value after `,` instead of the closing `]`. The JSONPath `$.languages[2]` in the exception message also points there: `$.` refers to the root object, `languages` refers to its member of that name and `[2]` refers to the (missing) third value in the JSON array value of that member (numbering starts at 0, so it is `[2]` instead of `[3]`).  \n132. The proper solution here is to fix the malformed JSON data.\n133. \n134. To spot syntax errors in the JSON data easily you can open it in an editor with support for JSON, for example Visual Studio Code. It will highlight within the JSON data the error location and show why the JSON data is considered invalid.\n135. \n136. ## <a id="number-parsed-as-double"></a> Integral JSON number is parsed as `double`\n137. \n138. **Symptom:** JSON data contains an integral number such as `45` but Gson returns it as `double`\n139. \n140. **Reason:** When parsing a JSON number as `Object`, Gson will by default create always return a `double`\n141. \n142. **Solution:** Use [`GsonBuilder.setObjectToNumberStrategy`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.html#setObjectToNumberStrategy(com.google.gson.ToNumberStrategy)) to specify what type of number should be returned\n143. \n144. ## <a id="default-lenient"></a> Malformed JSON not rejected\n145. \n146. **Symptom:** Gson parses malformed JSON without throwing any exceptions\n147. \n148. **Reason:** Due to legacy reasons Gson performs parsing by default in lenient mode\n149. \n150. **Solution:** See [`Gson` class documentation](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/Gson.html#default-lenient) section "Lenient JSON handling"\n151. \n152. Note: Even in non-lenient mode Gson deviates slightly from the JSON specification, see [`JsonReader.setLenient`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/stream/JsonReader.html#setLenient(boolean)) for more details.\n153. \n154. ## <a id="unexpected-json-structure"></a> `IllegalStateException`: "Expected ... but was ..."\n155. \n156. **Symptom:** An `IllegalStateException` with a message in the form "Expected ... but was ..." is thrown\n157. \n158. **Reason:** The JSON data does not have the correct format\n159. \n160. **Solution:** Make sure that your classes correctly model the JSON data. Also during debugging log the JSON data right before calling Gson methods or set a breakpoint to inspect the data and make sure it has the expected format. Read the location information of the exception message, it indicates where exactly in the document the error occurred, including the [JSONPath](https://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/).\n161. \n162. For example, let\'s assume you have the following Java class:\n163. \n164. ```java\n165. class WebPage {\n166.     String languages;\n167. }\n168. ```\n169. \n170. And you want to deserialize the following JSON data:\n171. \n172. ```json\n173. {\n174.   "languages": ["English", "French"]\n175. }\n176. ```\n177. \n178. This will fail with an exception similar to this one: `IllegalStateException: Expected a string but was BEGIN_ARRAY at line 2 column 17 path $.languages`  \n179. This means Gson expected a JSON string value but found the beginning of a JSON array (`[`). The location information "line 2 column 17" points to the `[` in the JSON data (with some slight inaccuracies), so does the JSONPath `$.languages` in the exception message. It refers to the `languages` member of the root object (`$.`).  \n180. The solution here is to change in the `WebPage` class the field `String languages` to `List<String> languages`.\n181. \n182. ## <a id="adapter-not-null-safe"></a> `IllegalStateException`: "Expected ... but was NULL"\n183. \n184. **Symptom:** An `IllegalStateException` with a message in the form "Expected ... but was NULL" is thrown\n185. \n186. **Reason:**\n187. \n188. - A built-in adapter does not support JSON null values\n189. - You have written a custom `TypeAdapter` which does not properly handle JSON null values\n190. \n191. **Solution:** If this occurs for a custom adapter you wrote, add code similar to the following at the beginning of its `read` method:\n192. \n193. ```java\n194. @Override\n195. public MyClass read(JsonReader in) throws IOException {\n196.     if (in.peek() == JsonToken.NULL) {\n197.         in.nextNull();\n198.         return null;\n199.     }\n200. \n201.     ...\n202. }\n203. ```\n204. \n205. Alternatively you can call [`nullSafe()`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html#nullSafe()) on the adapter instance you created.\n206. \n207. ## <a id="serialize-nulls"></a> Properties missing in JSON\n208. \n209. **Symptom:** Properties are missing in the JSON output\n210. \n211. **Reason:** Gson by default omits JSON null from the output (or: ProGuard / R8 is not configured correctly and removed unused fields)\n212. \n213. **Solution:** Use [`GsonBuilder.serializeNulls()`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.html#serializeNulls())\n214. \n215. Note: Gson does not support anonymous and local classes and will serialize them as JSON null, see the [related troubleshooting point](#null-values-for-anonymous-and-local-classes).\n216. \n217. ## <a id="android-internal-fields"></a> JSON output changes for newer Android versions\n218. \n219. **Symptom:** The JSON output differs when running on newer Android versions\n220. \n221. **Reason:** You use Gson by accident to access internal fields of Android classes\n222. \n223. **Solution:** Write custom Gson [`TypeAdapter`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html) implementations for the affected classes or change the type of your data\n224. \n225. **Explanation:**\n226. \n227. When no built-in adapter for a type exists and no custom adapter has been registered, Gson falls back to using reflection to access the fields of a class (including `private` ones). Most likely you are experiencing this issue because you (by accident) rely on the reflection-based adapter for Android classes. That should be avoided because you make yourself dependent on the implementation details of these classes which could change at any point.\n228. \n229. If you want to prevent using reflection on third-party classes in the future you can write your own [`ReflectionAccessFilter`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/ReflectionAccessFilter.html) or use one of the predefined ones, such as `ReflectionAccessFilter.BLOCK_ALL_PLATFORM`.\n230. \n231. ## <a id="json-static-fields"></a> JSON output contains values of `static` fields\n232. \n233. **Symptom:** The JSON output contains values of `static` fields\n234. \n235. **Reason:** You used `GsonBuilder.excludeFieldsWithModifiers` to overwrite the default excluded modifiers\n236. \n237. **Solution:** When calling `GsonBuilder.excludeFieldsWithModifiers` you overwrite the default excluded modifiers. Therefore, you have to explicitly exclude `static` fields if desired. This can be done by adding `Modifier.STATIC` as additional argument.\n238. \n239. ## <a id="no-such-method-error"></a> `NoSuchMethodError` when calling Gson methods\n240. \n241. **Symptom:** A `java.lang.NoSuchMethodError` is thrown when trying to call certain Gson methods\n242. \n243. **Reason:**\n244. \n245. - You have multiple versions of Gson on your classpath\n246. - Or, the Gson version you compiled against is different from the one on your classpath\n247. - Or, you are using a code shrinking tool such as ProGuard or R8 which removed methods from Gson\n248. \n249. **Solution:** First disable any code shrinking tools such as ProGuard or R8 and check if the issue persists. If not, you have to tweak the configuration of that tool to not modify Gson classes. Otherwise verify that the Gson JAR on your classpath is the same you are compiling against, and that there is only one Gson JAR on your classpath. See [this Stack Overflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/q/227486) to find out where a class is loaded from. For example, for debugging you could include the following code:\n250. \n251. ```java\n252. System.out.println(Gson.class.getProtectionDomain().getCodeSource().getLocation());\n253. ```\n254. \n255. If that fails with a `NullPointerException` you have to try one of the other ways to find out where a class is loaded from.\n256. \n257. ## <a id="duplicate-fields"></a> `IllegalArgumentException`: \'Class ... declares multiple JSON fields named \'...\'\'\n258. \n259. **Symptom:** An exception with the message \'Class ... declares multiple JSON fields named \'...\'\' is thrown\n260. \n261. **Reason:**\n262. \n263. - The name you have specified with a [`@SerializedName`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/annotations/SerializedName.html) annotation for a field collides with the name of another field\n264. - The [`FieldNamingStrategy`](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/FieldNamingStrategy.html) you have specified produces conflicting field names\n265. - A field of your class has the same name as the field of a superclass\n266. \n267. Gson prevents multiple fields with the same name because during deserialization it would be ambiguous for which field the JSON data should be deserialized. For serialization it would cause the same field to appear multiple times in JSON. While the JSON specification permits this, it is likely that the application parsing the JSON data will not handle it correctly.\n268. \n269. **Solution:** First identify the fields with conflicting names based on the exception message. Then decide if you want to rename one of them using the [`@SerializedName`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/annotations/SerializedName.html) annotation, or if you want to [exclude](UserGuide.md#excluding-fields-from-serialization-and-deserialization) one of them. When excluding one of the fields you have to include it for both serialization and deserialization (even if your application only performs one of these actions) because the duplicate field check cannot differentiate between these actions.\n270. \n271. ## <a id="java-lang-class-unsupported"></a> `UnsupportedOperationException` when serializing or deserializing `java.lang.Class`\n272. \n273. **Symptom:** An `UnsupportedOperationException` is thrown when trying to serialize or deserialize `java.lang.Class`\n274. \n275. **Reason:** Gson intentionally does not permit serializing and deserializing `java.lang.Class` for security reasons. Otherwise a malicious user could make your application load an arbitrary class from the classpath and, depending on what your application does with the `Class`, in the worst case perform a remote code execution attack.\n276. \n277. **Solution:** First check if you really need to serialize or deserialize a `Class`. Often it is possible to use string aliases and then map them to the known `Class`; you could write a custom [`TypeAdapter`](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html) to do this. If the `Class` values are not known in advance, try to introduce a common base class or interface for all these classes and then verify that the deserialized class is a subclass. For example assuming the base class is called `MyBaseClass`, your custom `TypeAdapter` should load the class like this:\n278. \n279. ```java\n280. Class.forName(jsonString, false, getClass().getClassLoader()).asSubclass(MyBaseClass.class)\n281. ```\n282. \n283. This will not initialize arbitrary classes, and it will throw a `ClassCastException` if the loaded class is not the same as or a subclass of `MyBaseClass`.\n284. \n285. ## <a id="type-token-raw"></a> `IllegalStateException`: \'TypeToken must be created with a type argument\' <br> `RuntimeException`: \'Missing type parameter\'\n286. \n287. **Symptom:** An `IllegalStateException` with the message \'TypeToken must be created with a type argument\' is thrown.  \n288. For older Gson versions a `RuntimeException` with message \'Missing type parameter\' is thrown.\n289. \n290. **Reason:**\n291. \n292. - You created a `TypeToken` without type argument, for example `new TypeToken() {}` (note the missing `<...>`). You always have to provide the type argument, for example like this: `new TypeToken<List<String>>() {}`. Normally the compiler will also emit a \'raw types\' warning when you forget the `<...>`.\n293. - You are using a code shrinking tool such as ProGuard or R8 (Android app builds normally have this enabled by default) but have not configured it correctly for usage with Gson.\n294. \n295. **Solution:** When you are using a code shrinking tool such as ProGuard or R8 you have to adjust your configuration to include the following rules:\n296. \n297. ```\n298. # Keep generic signatures; needed for correct type resolution\n299. -keepattributes Signature\n300. \n301. # Keep class TypeToken (respectively its generic signature)\n302. -keep class com.google.gson.reflect.TypeToken { *; }\n303. \n304. # Keep any (anonymous) classes extending TypeToken\n305. -keep class * extends com.google.gson.reflect.TypeToken\n306. ```\n307. \n308. See also the [Android example](examples/android-proguard-example/README.md) for more information.\n309. \n310. Note: For newer Gson versions these rules might be applied automatically; make sure you are using the latest Gson version and the latest version of the code shrinking tool.\n311. \n312. ## <a id="r8-abstract-class"></a> `JsonIOException`: \'Abstract classes can\'t be instantiated!\' (R8)\n313. \n314. **Symptom:** A `JsonIOException` with the message \'Abstract classes can\'t be instantiated!\' is thrown; the class mentioned in the exception message is not actually `abstract` in your source code, and you are using the code shrinking tool R8 (Android app builds normally have this configured by default).\n315. \n316. **Reason:** The code shrinking tool R8 performs optimizations where it removes the no-args constructor from a class and makes the class `abstract`. Due to this Gson cannot create an instance of the class.\n317. \n318. **Solution:** Make sure the class has a no-args constructor, then adjust your R8 configuration file to keep the constructor of the class. For example:\n319. \n320. ```\n321. # Keep the no-args constructor of the deserialized class\n322. -keepclassmembers class com.example.MyClass {\n323.   <init>();\n324. }\n325. ```\n326. \n327. For Android you can add this rule to the `proguard-rules.pro` file, see also the [Android documentation](https://developer.android.com/build/shrink-code#keep-code). In case the class name in the exception message is obfuscated, see the Android documentation about [retracing](https://developer.android.com/build/shrink-code#retracing).\n328. \n329. Note: If the class which you are trying to deserialize is actually abstract, then this exception is probably unrelated to R8 and you will have to implement a custom [`InstanceCreator`](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/InstanceCreator.html) or [`TypeAdapter`](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html) which creates an instance of a non-abstract subclass of the class.\n\n\nFile: examples/android-proguard-example/README.md\nLine number range: 1 - 17\nContent:\n1. # android-proguard-example\n2. \n3. Example Android project showing how to properly configure [ProGuard](https://www.guardsquare.com/proguard).\n4. ProGuard is a tool for \'shrinking\' and obfuscating compiled classes. It can rename methods and fields,\n5. or remove them if they appear to be unused. This can cause issues for Gson which uses Java reflection to\n6. access the fields of a class. It is necessary to configure ProGuard to make sure that Gson works correctly.\n7. \n8. Also have a look at the [ProGuard manual](https://www.guardsquare.com/manual/configuration/usage#keepoverview)\n9. and the [ProGuard Gson examples](https://www.guardsquare.com/manual/configuration/examples#gson) for more\n10. details on how ProGuard can be configured.\n11. \n12. The R8 code shrinker uses the same rule format as ProGuard, but there are differences between these two\n13. tools. Have a look at R8\'s Compatibility FAQ, and especially at the [Gson section](https://r8.googlesource.com/r8/+/refs/heads/main/compatibility-faq.md#gson).\n14. \n15. Note that newer Gson versions apply some of the rules shown in `proguard.cfg` automatically by default,\n16. see the file [`gson/META-INF/proguard/gson.pro`](/gson/src/main/resources/META-INF/proguard/gson.pro) for\n17. the Gson version you are using.\n\n\nFile: gson/src/main/java/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.java\nLine number range: 103 - 106\nContent:\n103.   private boolean generateNonExecutableJson = DEFAULT_JSON_NON_EXECUTABLE;\n104.   private boolean lenient = DEFAULT_LENIENT;\n105.   private boolean useJdkUnsafe = DEFAULT_USE_JDK_UNSAFE;\n106.   private ToNumberStrategy objectToNumberStrategy = DEFAULT_OBJECT_TO_NUMBER_STRATEGY;\n\n\nFile: gson/src/main/java/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.java\nLine number range: 756 - 760\nContent:\n756.   @CanIgnoreReturnValue\n757.   public GsonBuilder disableJdkUnsafe() {\n758.     this.useJdkUnsafe = false;\n759.     return this;\n760.   }\n\n\nFile: gson/src/main/java/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.java\nLine number range: 806 - 813\nContent:\n806.     return new Gson(excluder, fieldNamingPolicy, new HashMap<>(instanceCreators),\n807.         serializeNulls, complexMapKeySerialization,\n808.         generateNonExecutableJson, escapeHtmlChars, formattingStyle, lenient,\n809.         serializeSpecialFloatingPointValues, useJdkUnsafe, longSerializationPolicy,\n810.         datePattern, dateStyle, timeStyle, new ArrayList<>(this.factories),\n811.         new ArrayList<>(this.hierarchyFactories), factories,\n812.         objectToNumberStrategy, numberToNumberStrategy, new ArrayList<>(reflectionFilters));\n813.   }\n\n\nFile: gson/src/main/java/com/google/gson/JsonIOException.java\nLine number range: 16 - 45\nContent:\n16. package com.google.gson;\n17. \n18. /**\n19.  * This exception is raised when Gson was unable to read an input stream\n20.  * or write to one.\n21.  * \n22.  * @author Inderjeet Singh\n23.  * @author Joel Leitch\n24.  */\n25. public final class JsonIOException extends JsonParseException {\n26.   private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;\n27. \n28.   public JsonIOException(String msg) {\n29.     super(msg);\n30.   }\n31. \n32.   public JsonIOException(String msg, Throwable cause) {\n33.     super(msg, cause);\n34.   }\n35. \n36.   /**\n37.    * Creates exception with the specified cause.

An exclusion for serialized/deserialized classes over Gson is needed. For a package containing your classes looks like this

```
# Application classes that will be serialized/deserialized over Gson -keep class com.myapplication.model.api. { ; } 
```

Also add this [...] # Gson uses generic type information stored in a class file when working with # fields. Proguard removes such information by default, keep it. -keepattributes Signature # This is also needed for R8 in compat mode since multiple # optimizations will remove the generic signature such as class # merging and argument removal. See: #  -keep class com.google.gson.reflect.TypeToken { ; } -keep class  extends com.google.gson.reflect.TypeToken # Optional. For using GSON @Expose annotation

As consumer of GSON library, do I still need to explicitly include rules specified here in the file below, as far as I can tell those changes are merged.

Title: Improve default ProGuard / R8 rules and Troubleshooting ...
URL: https://github.com/google/gson/issues/2401
Content: There is probably no general way to detect if a class might be used with Gson, but the most reliable variant might be to keep the constructor if any of the Gson annotations is used by a class.

This can probably be achieved with an `-if` rule (see also answers to this Stack Overflow question). For example:

```
# If class has fields with `@SerializedName` annotation keep its constructors -if class  { @com.google.gson.annotations.SerializedName ; } -keep class <1> { (...); } 
``` [...] (duplicated for all Gson annotations)

But it looks like this is not enough, maybe because there is no `-keep` (or `-keepclasseswithmembers`) rule for the class in the first place so `-if` somehow has no effect? You additionally need the following (duplicated for all Gson annotations probably):

```
-keepclasseswithmembers class  { @com.google.gson.annotations.SerializedName ; } 
```

Only then the class is not made abstract and the constructor is properly kept... [...] (As side note: Having only the `-keepclasseswithmembers ... { @SerializedName }` above, but not the `-if ... -keep` seems to prevent R8 from making the class abstract, but still removes all constructors, so users would be dependent on JDK Unsafe then.)

Or similar to #2379 (comment) maybe the following would work as well:

```
-keepclasseswithmembers class  { (...); @com.google.gson.annotations.SerializedName ; } 
```

This should reduce occurrences of “Abstract classes can’t be instantiated!” and related constructor issues.\n  - Update documentation to recommend rules that keep all constructors for deserialized classes, clarify when -keep vs -keepclassmembers matters, and present Android-friendly alternatives like the @Keep annotation.\n  - Ensure the exception messaging points users to the correct Troubleshooting Guide entry even when R8 makes a class abstract but still leaves some constructors present.\n\n- Ambiguities and decisions:\n  - Constructor retention granularity: Recommend keeping all constructors (<init>(...)) rather than only the no-arg constructor (<init>()) because Kotlin classes frequently lack a no-arg constructor.\n  - Rule class scope: Favor rules that target classes indicating Gson usage via annotations rather than attempting to keep constructors of all consumer classes (minimize overreach).\n  - -keep vs -keepclassmembers:\n    - -keepclassmembers only keeps specified members and can still allow class-level transformations; in some cases R8 may still prune constructors or alter abstractness.\n    - -keepclasseswithmembers keeps the class and members when the class matches the specified condition; use this with constructor retention to avoid R8 changing abstractness and to keep constructors.\n    - To avoid negative impact on obfuscation, include allowobfuscation for these rules so class names can still be obfuscated where possible.\n  - Include an Android recommendation for @Keep on classes or constructors as a simpler option for developers who control source annotations.\n\nArchitecture Analysis\n\n- Files to modify:\n  - gson/src/main/resources/META-INF/proguard/gson.pro\n    - Add rules to keep constructors for classes using Gson annotations.\n    - Ensure attributes required for Gson are retained (e.g., generic signatures for TypeToken; runtime annotations).\n    - Prefer rules compatible with both ProGuard and R8.\n  - Troubleshooting.md\n    - Update the “JsonIOException: Abstract classes can't be instantiated!

Implement conditional retention by:\n    - Adding rules that match classes having fields or types annotated with Gson annotations (SerializedName, Expose, JsonAdapter, Since, Until).\n    - For those matched classes, keep all constructors.\n  - Use -keepclasseswithmembers for these conditional matches to ensure the class is not made abstract and constructors are retained. Include the allowobfuscation modifier so class/member names may still be obfuscated if desired by users.\n  - Retain runtime-visible annotations and generic signatures where needed:\n    - Ensure keepattributes Signature is present for TypeToken generic handling.\n    - Ensure runtime annotations are preserved on matched classes (RuntimeVisibleAnnotations). For R8 “full mode” behavior where keepattributes only applies to kept classes, rely on the conditional -keepclasseswithmembers rules to match classes with Gson annotations, so attributes are preserved on those classes.\n  - Ensure the shipped rules do not broadly keep all user model classes; scope rules to those with Gson annotations so the default remains minimally invasive.\n\n2) Troubleshooting Guide improvements\n- File: Troubleshooting.md\n- Update section “JsonIOException: 'Abstract classes can't be instantiated!' (R8)”:\n  - Replace the current example that only keeps the no-arg constructor with guidance to keep all constructors for the class mentioned in the error.\n  - Clarify when to use -keepclasseswithmembers vs -keepclassmembers:\n    - Recommend -keepclasseswithmembers with a constructor match to prevent R8 from making the class abstract and to keep constructors.\n    - Mention that -keep may be used if the user wants to unconditionally keep a specific class.\n  - Add Kotlin-specific guidance:\n    - Explain that Kotlin classes commonly lack a no-arg constructor and that keeping all constructors avoids issues.\n    - Note that using all-constructors retention may make Gson rely on JDK Unsafe for instantiation when no suitable constructor exists; advise making a no-arg constructor available if default field initialization is important; highlight GsonBuilder.disableJdkUnsafe() for early detection of missing constructors.\n  - Add an Android recommendation to use @Keep (either on the class or on the constructor) as a simpler alternative to shrinker configuration for users who control the source.\n  - Preserve the anchor id r8-abstract-class.\n- Update the TypeToken troubleshooting section to note that some rules are applied automatically via gson.pro but that project shrinker modes/configurations may still require explicit rules, and reference the Android example.\n- In the “Default field values missing” section, link to the guidance about constructors and Unsafe so the two points cross-reference each other.\n\n3) Android example README enhancements\n- File: examples/android-proguard-example/README.md\n- Expand the example to:\n  - Show a rule that conditionally keeps all constructors when Gson annotations are present on a class, and that includes allowobfuscation to minimize obfuscation impact.\n  - Highlight the @Keep alternative on classes/constructors and when to prefer it (e.g., if you own the model classes).\n  - Explain why keeping only a no-arg constructor can be insufficient for Kotlin classes, and when to add a no-arg constructor vs relying on Unsafe.\n  - Reiterate preserving generic signatures for TypeToken and preserving runtime annotations.\n  - Mention R8’s compatibility and differences vs ProGuard and why conditional rules are preferred.\n\n4) Error message behavior in ConstructorConstructor\n- File: gson/src/main/java/com/google/gson/internal/ConstructorConstructor.java\n- Method to change:\n  - checkInstantiable(Class<?> c)\n- Change:\n  - If the class is abstract, include the Troubleshooting Guide link unconditionally in the returned message. Remove the current condition that includes the link only when there are zero declared constructors.\n  - Keep the distinction in plain text that abstract classes cannot be instantiated and suggest registering an InstanceCreator or TypeAdapter for genuinely abstract types. The Troubleshooting Guide section should explicitly cover both cases (R8-induced abstractness vs genuinely abstract source).\n- Integration:\n  - This change ensures that, even if R8 leaves some constructor artifacts on an abstract class, users still see the URL that explains R8-related adjustments.\n  - Verify that other JsonIOException messages thrown through ObjectConstructor wrappers remain consistent with expectations and do not regress tests.\n\nConsiderations\n\n- Impact on existing functionality:\n  - The gson.pro changes only affect consumer classes that use Gson annotations; they do not broadly keep all classes. Using allowobfuscation on keep rules reduces the impact on obfuscation.\n  - ConstructorConstructor message changes affect the exact error text. Tests that assert message contents may need to be updated to expect the Troubleshooting Guide URL in more abstract-class paths.\n\n- Backward compatibility:\n  - Preserve Troubleshooting Guide anchors (e.g., r8-abstract-class) so existing links remain valid.\n  - Avoid broad keep rules in gson.pro that would alter consumers’ obfuscation patterns. Keep rules should be conditional and include allowobfuscation.\n  - Do not alter existing behavior of GsonBuilder.disableJdkUnsafe(); only the documentation references need adjusting.\n\n- Dependencies and prerequisites:\n  - R8 and ProGuard support the conditional matching required (e.g., -keepclasseswithmembers and, where used, -if semantics). Ensure the default rules use constructs supported by both tools; prefer -keepclasseswithmembers with constructor and annotation member patterns rather than relying solely on -if.\n  - Retaining runtime-visible annotations requires keepattributes RuntimeVisibleAnnotations; this typically applies only to classes matched by keep rules in R8 “full mode.” The conditional keep ensures attributes are retained on relevant classes.\n  - Some projects may not use any Gson annotations; the default rules cannot detect usage in that case. The Troubleshooting Guide should state that developers may still need to add explicit keep rules for specific classes that are deserialized without annotations.\n\nSummary of changes by file\n\n- gson/src/main/resources/META-INF/proguard/gson.pro\n  - Add conditional keep rules that match classes with Gson annotations and keep all constructors, with allowobfuscation.\n  - Ensure attributes for generic signatures and runtime annotations are preserved on matched classes.\n\n- Troubleshooting.md\n  - Update the R8 abstract class section to recommend keeping all constructors and clarify -keep vs -keepclasseswithmembers.\n  - Add Android @Keep recommendation and Kotlin constructor guidance.\n  - Cross-reference disableJdkUnsafe and TypeToken signature preservation.\n  - Maintain anchor IDs.\n\n- examples/android-proguard-example/README.md\n  - Include updated example rules and Android/Kotlin guidance.\n  - Explain rationale for allowobfuscation.\n\n- gson/src/main/java/com/google/gson/internal/ConstructorConstructor.java\n  - In checkInstantiable, always include the Troubleshooting Guide link on abstract-class failure messages, regardless of constructor presence.\n\nThese changes integrate default shrinker behavior with Gson usage patterns, improve developer guidance, and make error diagnostics more consistently actionable." additional_kwargs={'refusal': None} response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 4947, 'prompt_tokens': 17696, 'total_tokens': 22643, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'reasoning_tokens': 2560, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': 0, 'cached_tokens': 0}}, 'model_name': 'gpt-5-2025-08-07', 'system_fingerprint': None, 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None} id='run--ab6fc441-166d-48df-a214-251779426ec1-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 17696, 'output_tokens': 4947, 'total_tokens': 22643, 'input_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'cache_read': 0}, 'output_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'reasoning': 2560}}

content='--- BEGIN ISSUE INFO ---\nIssue title:\nImprove default ProGuard / R8 rules and Troubleshooting Guide\n\nIssue description: \n# Problem solved by the feature\nImprove the default ProGuard / R8 rules in `META-INF/proguard/gson.pro` added by #2397, and the Troubleshooting Guide.\n\n# Feature description\nI was testing the new default rules with an Android app and Kotlin classes, and there might be the following areas to improve.\n\n### Troubleshooting Guide: `JsonIOException`: \'Abstract classes can\'t be instantiated!\' (R8)\n\nThe Troubleshooting Guide currently suggests the following:\n```\n# Keep the no-args constructor of the deserialized class\n-keepclassmembers class com.example.MyClass {\n  <init>();\n}\n```\n\nThis means only the no-args constructor is kept, but not any other constructors. However, especially for Kotlin I assume it is common that classes don\'t have a no-args constructor because you might declare properties and the primary constructor at once, e.g. `class MyClass(val s: String)` (see [Kotlin documentation](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/classes.html#constructors)). Not sure though if using that is a good idea in combination with Gson because it then requires JDK Unsafe to create instances, but that is a different topic.\n\nSo there are two questions:\n- Should the Troubleshooting Guide rather recommend `<init>(...);` (all constructors), so that the users don\'t experience issues with R8 anymore (but implicitly depend on JDK Unsafe; using `GsonBuilder.disableJdkUnsafe()` would cause Gson to fail with a different exception)\n- Should the Troubleshooting Guide recommend `-keep` instead of `-keepclassmembers`. In case the `<init>` rule for the class properly matches a constructor it might not matter. But in case `<init>();` is used, but a no-args constructor does not exist, then `-keep` seems to at least have the side-effect that R8 does not make the class abstract (and then using JDK Unsafe an instance can be created).\n\n### Troubleshooting Guide: Recommend `@Keep` for Android\nInstead of configuring ProGuard / R8 rules, it might be easier for Android developers to use `@Keep` on the corresponding class or constructor, see https://developer.android.com/studio/write/annotations#keep\n\n### Preventing R8 from making classes abstract / removing no-args constructor\n\nIt would be good if we could adjust the default rules to avoid the "Abstract classes can\'t be instantiated!" exception (for most cases) in the first place.\n\nThere is probably no general way to detect if a class might be used with Gson, but the most reliable variant might be to keep the constructor if any of the Gson annotations is used by a class.\n\nThis can probably be achieved with an [`-if` rule](https://www.guardsquare.com/manual/configuration/usage#if) (see also [answers to this Stack Overflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/q/63162818)). For example:\n```\n# If class has fields with `@SerializedName` annotation keep its constructors\n-if class * {\n  @com.google.gson.annotations.SerializedName <fields>;\n}\n-keep class <1> {\n  <init>(...);\n}\n```\n(duplicated for all Gson annotations)\n\nBut it looks like this is not enough, maybe because there is no `-keep` (or `-keepclasseswithmembers`) rule for the class in the first place so `-if` somehow has no effect? You additionally need the following (duplicated for all Gson annotations probably):\n```\n-keepclasseswithmembers class * {\n  @com.google.gson.annotations.SerializedName <fields>;\n}\n```\nOnly then the class is not made abstract and the constructor is properly kept...\n\n(As side note: Having only the `-keepclasseswithmembers ... { @SerializedName }` above, but not the `-if ... -keep` seems to prevent R8 from making the class abstract, but still removes all constructors, so users would be dependent on JDK Unsafe then.)\n\nOr similar to https://github.com/google/gson/issues/2379#issuecomment-1564517629 maybe the following would work as well:\n```\n-keepclasseswithmembers class * {\n  <init>(...);\n  @com.google.gson.annotations.SerializedName <fields>;\n}\n```\nThere is however probably no need for the `-if` rule shown in the original comment, unless that has some special effect, see https://github.com/google/gson/pull/2397#issuecomment-1575236086.\n\n### R8 makes class abstract but still keeps constructors\n\nIt also looks like the Android app build creates (for some reason) additional constructors / keeps constructors even when the class is made abstract. Due to this, the Troubleshooting Guide URLs are unfortunately not included in the exception messages (they are only added at the moment when there are no constructors).\nNot really sure why these constructors exist in the first place and are kept even when the class is made abstract. In the R8 integration test of Gson this behavior was not seen.\n\nMaybe we should remove the `getDeclaredConstructors().length == 0` check if the class is abstract and always refer to the Troubleshooting Guide. The guide would have to be adjusted then though to also properly cover the case where the class was indeed abstract in the source code.\n\n---\n\nAny additional feedback is highly appreciated!\n\n\nIssue comments:\n\n--- END ISSUE INFO ---\n\nContext Found:\n--- BEGIN CONTEXT ---\nFile: Troubleshooting.md\nLine number range: 1 - 329\nContent:\n1. # Troubleshooting Guide\n2. \n3.

See the [user guide](UserGuide.md#collections-examples) for more information.\n18. - When using `TypeToken` prefer the `Gson.fromJson` overloads with `TypeToken` parameter such as [`fromJson(Reader, TypeToken)`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/Gson.html#fromJson(java.io.Reader,com.google.gson.reflect.TypeToken)).\n19.   The overloads with `Type` parameter do not provide any type-safety guarantees.\n20. - When using `TypeToken` make sure you don\'t capture a type variable. For example avoid something like `new TypeToken<List<T>>()` (where `T` is a type variable). Due to Java type erasure the actual type of `T` is not available at runtime. Refactor your code to pass around `TypeToken` instances or use [`TypeToken.getParameterized(...)`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/reflect/TypeToken.html#getParameterized(java.lang.reflect.Type,java.lang.reflect.Type...)), for example `TypeToken.getParameterized(List.class, elementClass)`.\n21. \n22. ## <a id="reflection-inaccessible"></a> `InaccessibleObjectException`: \'module ... does not "opens ..." to unnamed module\'\n23. \n24. **Symptom:** An exception with a message in the form \'module ... does not "opens ..." to unnamed module\' is thrown\n25. \n26. **Reason:** You use Gson by accident to access internal fields of third-party classes\n27. \n28. **Solution:** Write custom Gson [`TypeAdapter`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html) implementations for the affected classes or change the type of your data. If this occurs for a field in one of your classes which you did not actually want to serialize or deserialize in the first place, you can exclude that field, see the [user guide](UserGuide.md#excluding-fields-from-serialization-and-deserialization).\n29. \n30. **Explanation:**\n31. \n32. When no built-in adapter for a type exists and no custom adapter has been registered, Gson falls back to using reflection to access the fields of a class (including `private` ones). Most likely you are seeing this error because you (by accident) rely on the reflection-based adapter for third-party classes. That should be avoided because you make yourself dependent on the implementation details of these classes which could change at any point. For the JDK it is also not possible anymore to access internal fields using reflection starting with JDK 17, see [JEP 403](https://openjdk.org/jeps/403).\n33. \n34. If you want to prevent using reflection on third-party classes in the future you can write your own [`ReflectionAccessFilter`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/ReflectionAccessFilter.html) or use one of the predefined ones, such as `ReflectionAccessFilter.BLOCK_ALL_PLATFORM`.\n35. \n36. ## <a id="reflection-inaccessible-to-module-gson"></a> `InaccessibleObjectException`: \'module ... does not "opens ..." to module com.google.gson\'\n37. \n38. **Symptom:** An exception with a message in the form \'module ... does not "opens ..." to module com.google.gson\' is thrown\n39. \n40. **Reason:**\n41. \n42. - If the reported package is your own package then you have not configured the module declaration of your project to allow Gson to use reflection on your classes.\n43. - If the reported package is from a third party library or the JDK see [this troubleshooting point](#inaccessibleobjectexception-module--does-not-opens--to-unnamed-module).\n44. \n45. **Solution:** Make sure the `module-info.java` file of your project allows Gson to use reflection on your classes, for example:\n46. \n47. ```java\n48. module mymodule {\n49.     requires com.google.gson;\n50. \n51.     opens mypackage to com.google.gson;\n52. }\n53. ```\n54. \n55. Or in case this occurs for a field in one of your classes which you did not actually want to serialize or deserialize in the first place, you can exclude that field, see the [user guide](UserGuide.md#excluding-fields-from-serialization-and-deserialization).\n56. \n57. ## <a id="android-app-random-names"></a> Android app not working in Release mode; random property names\n58. \n59. **Symptom:** Your Android app is working fine in Debug mode but fails in Release mode and the JSON properties have seemingly random names such as `a`, `b`, ...\n60. \n61. **Reason:** You probably have not configured ProGuard / R8 correctly\n62. \n63. **Solution:** Make sure you have configured ProGuard / R8 correctly to preserve the names of your fields. See the [Android example](examples/android-proguard-example/README.md) for more information.\n64. \n65. ## <a id="android-app-broken-after-app-update"></a> Android app unable to parse JSON after app update\n66. \n67. **Symptom:** You released a new version of your Android app and it fails to parse JSON data created by the previous version of your app\n68. \n69. **Reason:** You probably have not configured ProGuard / R8 correctly; probably the fields names are being obfuscated and their naming changed between the versions of your app\n70. \n71. **Solution:** Make sure you have configured ProGuard / R8 correctly to preserve the names of your fields. See the [Android example](examples/android-proguard-example/README.md) for more information.\n72. \n73. If you want to preserve backward compatibility for you app you can use [`@SerializedName`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/annotations/SerializedName.html) on the fields to specify the obfuscated name as alternate, for example: `@SerializedName(value = "myprop", alternate = "a")`\n74. \n75. Normally ProGuard and R8 produce a mapping file, this makes it easier to find out the obfuscated field names instead of having to find them out through trial and error or other means. See the [Android Studio user guide](https://developer.android.com/studio/build/shrink-code.html#retracing) for more information.\n76. \n77. ## <a id="default-field-values-missing"></a> Default field values not present after deserialization\n78. \n79. **Symptom:** You have assign default values to fields but after deserialization the fields have their standard value (such as `null` or `0`)\n80. \n81. **Reason:** Gson cannot invoke the constructor of your class and falls back to JDK `Unsafe` (or similar means)\n82. \n83. **Solution:** Make sure that the class:\n84. \n85. - is `static` (explicitly or implicitly when it is a top-level class)\n86. - has a no-args constructor\n87. \n88. Otherwise Gson will by default try to use JDK `Unsafe` or similar means to create an instance of your class without invoking the constructor and without running any initializers. You can also disable that behavior through [`GsonBuilder.disableJdkUnsafe()`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.html#disableJdkUnsafe()) to notice such issues early on.\n89. \n90. ## <a id="anonymous-local-null"></a> `null` values for anonymous and local classes\n91. \n92. **Symptom:** Objects of a class are always serialized as JSON `null` / always deserialized as Java `null`\n93. \n94. **Reason:** The class you are serializing or deserializing is an anonymous or a local class (or you have specified a custom `ExclusionStrategy`)\n95. \n96. **Solution:** Convert the class to a `static` nested class. If the class is already `static` make sure you have not specified a Gson `ExclusionStrategy` which might exclude the class.\n97. \n98. Notes:\n99. \n100. - "double brace-initialization" also creates anonymous classes\n101. - Local record classes (feature added in Java 16) are supported by Gson and are not affected by this\n102. \n103. ## <a id="map-key-wrong-json"></a> Map keys having unexpected format in JSON\n104. \n105. **Symptom:** JSON output for `Map` keys is unexpected / cannot be deserialized again\n106. \n107. **Reason:** The `Map` key type is \'complex\' and you have not configured the `GsonBuilder` properly\n108. \n109. **Solution:** Use [`GsonBuilder.enableComplexMapKeySerialization()`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.html#enableComplexMapKeySerialization()). See also the [user guide](UserGuide.md#maps-examples) for more information.\n110. \n111. ## <a id="malformed-json"></a> Parsing JSON fails with `MalformedJsonException`\n112. \n113. **Symptom:** JSON parsing fails with `MalformedJsonException`\n114. \n115. **Reason:** The JSON data is actually malformed\n116. \n117. **Solution:** During debugging, log the JSON data right before calling Gson methods or set a breakpoint to inspect the data and make sure it has the expected format. Sometimes APIs might return HTML error pages (instead of JSON data) when reaching rate limits or when other errors occur. Also read the location information of the `MalformedJsonException` exception message, it indicates where exactly in the document the malformed data was detected, including the [JSONPath](https://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/).\n118. \n119. For example, let\'s assume you want to deserialize the following JSON data:\n120. \n121. ```json\n122. {\n123.   "languages": [\n124.     "English",\n125.     "French",\n126.   ]\n127. }\n128. ```\n129. \n130. This will fail with an exception similar to this one: `MalformedJsonException: Use JsonReader.setLenient(true) to accept malformed JSON at line 5 column 4 path $.languages[2]`  \n131. The problem here is the trailing comma (`,`) after `"French"`, trailing commas are not allowed by the JSON specification. The location information "line 5 column 4" points to the `]` in the JSON data (with some slight inaccuracies) because Gson expected another value after `,` instead of the closing `]`. The JSONPath `$.languages[2]` in the exception message also points there: `$.` refers to the root object, `languages` refers to its member of that name and `[2]` refers to the (missing) third value in the JSON array value of that member (numbering starts at 0, so it is `[2]` instead of `[3]`).  \n132. The proper solution here is to fix the malformed JSON data.\n133. \n134. To spot syntax errors in the JSON data easily you can open it in an editor with support for JSON, for example Visual Studio Code. It will highlight within the JSON data the error location and show why the JSON data is considered invalid.\n135. \n136. ## <a id="number-parsed-as-double"></a> Integral JSON number is parsed as `double`\n137. \n138. **Symptom:** JSON data contains an integral number such as `45` but Gson returns it as `double`\n139. \n140. **Reason:** When parsing a JSON number as `Object`, Gson will by default create always return a `double`\n141. \n142. **Solution:** Use [`GsonBuilder.setObjectToNumberStrategy`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.html#setObjectToNumberStrategy(com.google.gson.ToNumberStrategy)) to specify what type of number should be returned\n143. \n144. ## <a id="default-lenient"></a> Malformed JSON not rejected\n145. \n146. **Symptom:** Gson parses malformed JSON without throwing any exceptions\n147. \n148. **Reason:** Due to legacy reasons Gson performs parsing by default in lenient mode\n149. \n150. **Solution:** See [`Gson` class documentation](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/Gson.html#default-lenient) section "Lenient JSON handling"\n151. \n152. Note: Even in non-lenient mode Gson deviates slightly from the JSON specification, see [`JsonReader.setLenient`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/stream/JsonReader.html#setLenient(boolean)) for more details.\n153. \n154. ## <a id="unexpected-json-structure"></a> `IllegalStateException`: "Expected ... but was ..."\n155. \n156. **Symptom:** An `IllegalStateException` with a message in the form "Expected ... but was ..." is thrown\n157. \n158. **Reason:** The JSON data does not have the correct format\n159. \n160. **Solution:** Make sure that your classes correctly model the JSON data. Also during debugging log the JSON data right before calling Gson methods or set a breakpoint to inspect the data and make sure it has the expected format. Read the location information of the exception message, it indicates where exactly in the document the error occurred, including the [JSONPath](https://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/).\n161. \n162. For example, let\'s assume you have the following Java class:\n163. \n164. ```java\n165. class WebPage {\n166.     String languages;\n167. }\n168. ```\n169. \n170. And you want to deserialize the following JSON data:\n171. \n172. ```json\n173. {\n174.   "languages": ["English", "French"]\n175. }\n176. ```\n177. \n178. This will fail with an exception similar to this one: `IllegalStateException: Expected a string but was BEGIN_ARRAY at line 2 column 17 path $.languages`  \n179. This means Gson expected a JSON string value but found the beginning of a JSON array (`[`). The location information "line 2 column 17" points to the `[` in the JSON data (with some slight inaccuracies), so does the JSONPath `$.languages` in the exception message. It refers to the `languages` member of the root object (`$.`).  \n180. The solution here is to change in the `WebPage` class the field `String languages` to `List<String> languages`.\n181. \n182. ## <a id="adapter-not-null-safe"></a> `IllegalStateException`: "Expected ... but was NULL"\n183. \n184. **Symptom:** An `IllegalStateException` with a message in the form "Expected ... but was NULL" is thrown\n185. \n186. **Reason:**\n187. \n188. - A built-in adapter does not support JSON null values\n189. - You have written a custom `TypeAdapter` which does not properly handle JSON null values\n190. \n191. **Solution:** If this occurs for a custom adapter you wrote, add code similar to the following at the beginning of its `read` method:\n192. \n193. ```java\n194. @Override\n195. public MyClass read(JsonReader in) throws IOException {\n196.     if (in.peek() == JsonToken.NULL) {\n197.         in.nextNull();\n198.         return null;\n199.     }\n200. \n201.     ...\n202. }\n203. ```\n204. \n205. Alternatively you can call [`nullSafe()`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html#nullSafe()) on the adapter instance you created.\n206. \n207. ## <a id="serialize-nulls"></a> Properties missing in JSON\n208. \n209. **Symptom:** Properties are missing in the JSON output\n210. \n211. **Reason:** Gson by default omits JSON null from the output (or: ProGuard / R8 is not configured correctly and removed unused fields)\n212. \n213. **Solution:** Use [`GsonBuilder.serializeNulls()`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.html#serializeNulls())\n214. \n215. Note: Gson does not support anonymous and local classes and will serialize them as JSON null, see the [related troubleshooting point](#null-values-for-anonymous-and-local-classes).\n216. \n217. ## <a id="android-internal-fields"></a> JSON output changes for newer Android versions\n218. \n219. **Symptom:** The JSON output differs when running on newer Android versions\n220. \n221. **Reason:** You use Gson by accident to access internal fields of Android classes\n222. \n223. **Solution:** Write custom Gson [`TypeAdapter`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html) implementations for the affected classes or change the type of your data\n224. \n225. **Explanation:**\n226. \n227. When no built-in adapter for a type exists and no custom adapter has been registered, Gson falls back to using reflection to access the fields of a class (including `private` ones). Most likely you are experiencing this issue because you (by accident) rely on the reflection-based adapter for Android classes. That should be avoided because you make yourself dependent on the implementation details of these classes which could change at any point.\n228. \n229. If you want to prevent using reflection on third-party classes in the future you can write your own [`ReflectionAccessFilter`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/ReflectionAccessFilter.html) or use one of the predefined ones, such as `ReflectionAccessFilter.BLOCK_ALL_PLATFORM`.\n230. \n231. ## <a id="json-static-fields"></a> JSON output contains values of `static` fields\n232. \n233. **Symptom:** The JSON output contains values of `static` fields\n234. \n235. **Reason:** You used `GsonBuilder.excludeFieldsWithModifiers` to overwrite the default excluded modifiers\n236. \n237. **Solution:** When calling `GsonBuilder.excludeFieldsWithModifiers` you overwrite the default excluded modifiers. Therefore, you have to explicitly exclude `static` fields if desired. This can be done by adding `Modifier.STATIC` as additional argument.\n238. \n239. ## <a id="no-such-method-error"></a> `NoSuchMethodError` when calling Gson methods\n240. \n241. **Symptom:** A `java.lang.NoSuchMethodError` is thrown when trying to call certain Gson methods\n242. \n243. **Reason:**\n244. \n245. - You have multiple versions of Gson on your classpath\n246. - Or, the Gson version you compiled against is different from the one on your classpath\n247. - Or, you are using a code shrinking tool such as ProGuard or R8 which removed methods from Gson\n248. \n249. **Solution:** First disable any code shrinking tools such as ProGuard or R8 and check if the issue persists. If not, you have to tweak the configuration of that tool to not modify Gson classes. Otherwise verify that the Gson JAR on your classpath is the same you are compiling against, and that there is only one Gson JAR on your classpath. See [this Stack Overflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/q/227486) to find out where a class is loaded from. For example, for debugging you could include the following code:\n250. \n251. ```java\n252. System.out.println(Gson.class.getProtectionDomain().getCodeSource().getLocation());\n253. ```\n254. \n255. If that fails with a `NullPointerException` you have to try one of the other ways to find out where a class is loaded from.\n256. \n257. ## <a id="duplicate-fields"></a> `IllegalArgumentException`: \'Class ... declares multiple JSON fields named \'...\'\'\n258. \n259. **Symptom:** An exception with the message \'Class ... declares multiple JSON fields named \'...\'\' is thrown\n260. \n261. **Reason:**\n262. \n263. - The name you have specified with a [`@SerializedName`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/annotations/SerializedName.html) annotation for a field collides with the name of another field\n264. - The [`FieldNamingStrategy`](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/FieldNamingStrategy.html) you have specified produces conflicting field names\n265. - A field of your class has the same name as the field of a superclass\n266. \n267. Gson prevents multiple fields with the same name because during deserialization it would be ambiguous for which field the JSON data should be deserialized. For serialization it would cause the same field to appear multiple times in JSON. While the JSON specification permits this, it is likely that the application parsing the JSON data will not handle it correctly.\n268. \n269. **Solution:** First identify the fields with conflicting names based on the exception message. Then decide if you want to rename one of them using the [`@SerializedName`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/annotations/SerializedName.html) annotation, or if you want to [exclude](UserGuide.md#excluding-fields-from-serialization-and-deserialization) one of them. When excluding one of the fields you have to include it for both serialization and deserialization (even if your application only performs one of these actions) because the duplicate field check cannot differentiate between these actions.\n270. \n271. ## <a id="java-lang-class-unsupported"></a> `UnsupportedOperationException` when serializing or deserializing `java.lang.Class`\n272. \n273. **Symptom:** An `UnsupportedOperationException` is thrown when trying to serialize or deserialize `java.lang.Class`\n274. \n275. **Reason:** Gson intentionally does not permit serializing and deserializing `java.lang.Class` for security reasons. Otherwise a malicious user could make your application load an arbitrary class from the classpath and, depending on what your application does with the `Class`, in the worst case perform a remote code execution attack.\n276. \n277. **Solution:** First check if you really need to serialize or deserialize a `Class`. Often it is possible to use string aliases and then map them to the known `Class`; you could write a custom [`TypeAdapter`](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html) to do this. If the `Class` values are not known in advance, try to introduce a common base class or interface for all these classes and then verify that the deserialized class is a subclass. For example assuming the base class is called `MyBaseClass`, your custom `TypeAdapter` should load the class like this:\n278. \n279. ```java\n280. Class.forName(jsonString, false, getClass().getClassLoader()).asSubclass(MyBaseClass.class)\n281. ```\n282. \n283. This will not initialize arbitrary classes, and it will throw a `ClassCastException` if the loaded class is not the same as or a subclass of `MyBaseClass`.\n284. \n285. ## <a id="type-token-raw"></a> `IllegalStateException`: \'TypeToken must be created with a type argument\' <br> `RuntimeException`: \'Missing type parameter\'\n286. \n287. **Symptom:** An `IllegalStateException` with the message \'TypeToken must be created with a type argument\' is thrown.  \n288. For older Gson versions a `RuntimeException` with message \'Missing type parameter\' is thrown.\n289. \n290. **Reason:**\n291. \n292. - You created a `TypeToken` without type argument, for example `new TypeToken() {}` (note the missing `<...>`). You always have to provide the type argument, for example like this: `new TypeToken<List<String>>() {}`. Normally the compiler will also emit a \'raw types\' warning when you forget the `<...>`.\n293. - You are using a code shrinking tool such as ProGuard or R8 (Android app builds normally have this enabled by default) but have not configured it correctly for usage with Gson.\n294. \n295. **Solution:** When you are using a code shrinking tool such as ProGuard or R8 you have to adjust your configuration to include the following rules:\n296. \n297. ```\n298. # Keep generic signatures; needed for correct type resolution\n299. -keepattributes Signature\n300. \n301. # Keep class TypeToken (respectively its generic signature)\n302. -keep class com.google.gson.reflect.TypeToken { *; }\n303. \n304. # Keep any (anonymous) classes extending TypeToken\n305. -keep class * extends com.google.gson.reflect.TypeToken\n306. ```\n307. \n308. See also the [Android example](examples/android-proguard-example/README.md) for more information.\n309. \n310. Note: For newer Gson versions these rules might be applied automatically; make sure you are using the latest Gson version and the latest version of the code shrinking tool.\n311. \n312. ## <a id="r8-abstract-class"></a> `JsonIOException`: \'Abstract classes can\'t be instantiated!\' (R8)\n313. \n314. **Symptom:** A `JsonIOException` with the message \'Abstract classes can\'t be instantiated!\' is thrown; the class mentioned in the exception message is not actually `abstract` in your source code, and you are using the code shrinking tool R8 (Android app builds normally have this configured by default).\n315. \n316. **Reason:** The code shrinking tool R8 performs optimizations where it removes the no-args constructor from a class and makes the class `abstract`. Due to this Gson cannot create an instance of the class.\n317. \n318. **Solution:** Make sure the class has a no-args constructor, then adjust your R8 configuration file to keep the constructor of the class. For example:\n319. \n320. ```\n321. # Keep the no-args constructor of the deserialized class\n322. -keepclassmembers class com.example.MyClass {\n323.   <init>();\n324. }\n325. ```\n326. \n327. For Android you can add this rule to the `proguard-rules.pro` file, see also the [Android documentation](https://developer.android.com/build/shrink-code#keep-code). In case the class name in the exception message is obfuscated, see the Android documentation about [retracing](https://developer.android.com/build/shrink-code#retracing).\n328. \n329. Note: If the class which you are trying to deserialize is actually abstract, then this exception is probably unrelated to R8 and you will have to implement a custom [`InstanceCreator`](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/InstanceCreator.html) or [`TypeAdapter`](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html) which creates an instance of a non-abstract subclass of the class.\n\n\nFile: examples/android-proguard-example/README.md\nLine number range: 1 - 17\nContent:\n1. # android-proguard-example\n2. \n3. Example Android project showing how to properly configure [ProGuard](https://www.guardsquare.com/proguard).\n4. ProGuard is a tool for \'shrinking\' and obfuscating compiled classes. It can rename methods and fields,\n5. or remove them if they appear to be unused. This can cause issues for Gson which uses Java reflection to\n6. access the fields of a class. It is necessary to configure ProGuard to make sure that Gson works correctly.\n7. \n8. Also have a look at the [ProGuard manual](https://www.guardsquare.com/manual/configuration/usage#keepoverview)\n9. and the [ProGuard Gson examples](https://www.guardsquare.com/manual/configuration/examples#gson) for more\n10. details on how ProGuard can be configured.\n11. \n12.

Do NOT explore for more context in the codebase!\n\nAnalyzer agent has analyzed the issue and provided instruction on the issue:\n--- BEGIN ANALYZER MESSAGE ---\nFeature Understanding\n\n- Goal: Reduce R8/ProGuard-induced runtime failures with Gson by improving:\n  - The default rules shipped in META-INF/proguard/gson.pro\n  - The Troubleshooting Guide guidance for Android, Kotlin, and constructor retention\n  - Error messaging so users are reliably directed to the Troubleshooting Guide in cases where R8 has made classes abstract or pruned constructors\n\n- Desired functionality:\n  - Ship library default rules that proactively keep constructors of classes that are likely used with Gson, particularly those that use Gson annotations (SerializedName, Expose, JsonAdapter, Since, Until). This should reduce occurrences of “Abstract classes can’t be instantiated!” and related constructor issues.\n  - Update documentation to recommend rules that keep all constructors for deserialized classes, clarify when -keep vs -keepclassmembers matters, and present Android-friendly alternatives like the @Keep annotation.\n  - Ensure the exception messaging points users to the correct Troubleshooting Guide entry even when R8 makes a class abstract but still leaves some constructors present.\n\n- Ambiguities and decisions:\n  - Constructor retention granularity: Recommend keeping all constructors (<init>(...)) rather than only the no-arg constructor (<init>()) because Kotlin classes frequently lack a no-arg constructor.\n  - Rule class scope: Favor rules that target classes indicating Gson usage via annotations rather than attempting to keep constructors of all consumer classes (minimize overreach).\n  - -keep vs -keepclassmembers:\n    - -keepclassmembers only keeps specified members and can still allow class-level transformations; in some cases R8 may still prune constructors or alter abstractness.\n    - -keepclasseswithmembers keeps the class and members when the class matches the specified condition; use this with constructor retention to avoid R8 changing abstractness and to keep constructors.\n    - To avoid negative impact on obfuscation, include allowobfuscation for these rules so class names can still be obfuscated where possible.\n  - Include an Android recommendation for @Keep on classes or constructors as a simpler option for developers who control source annotations.\n\nArchitecture Analysis\n\n- Files to modify:\n  - gson/src/main/resources/META-INF/proguard/gson.pro\n    - Add rules to keep constructors for classes using Gson annotations.\n    - Ensure attributes required for Gson are retained (e.g., generic signatures for TypeToken; runtime annotations).\n    - Prefer rules compatible with both ProGuard and R8.\n  - Troubleshooting.md\n    - Update the “JsonIOException: Abstract classes can\'t be instantiated! (R8)” section to:\n      - Recommend keeping all constructors, not just no-arg.\n      - Explain when to use -keepclasseswithmembers and when -keep may be needed.\n      - Call out Kotlin primary constructor patterns and the use of @Keep.\n      - Clarify the interaction with GsonBuilder.disableJdkUnsafe().\n    - Update the “TypeToken must be created with a type argument” section to reflect that some rules are now shipped by default and highlight R8 considerations.\n    - Add guidance on @Keep for Android as an alternative to ProGuard/R8 configuration, including when to annotate the constructor vs the class.\n  - examples/android-proguard-example/README.md\n    - Expand examples to show recommended constructor-retention rules tied to Gson annotations and @Keep alternatives.\n    - Explain the effect of allowobfuscation and why to include it on keep rules.\n  - gson/src/main/java/com/google/gson/internal/ConstructorConstructor.java\n    - Adjust the abstract-class handling message in checkInstantiable(Class<?>):\n      - Remove the current dependency on “no declared constructors” for including the Troubleshooting Guide link.\n      - Always include a Troubleshooting Guide URL for abstract-class instantiation failures so the link appears even when R8 left synthetic or retained constructors.\n    - Ensure other exception flows (Unsafe disabled, reflection blocked) remain unchanged in behavior, but confirm they don’t regress tests.\n  - (No change) gson/src/main/java/com/google/gson/internal/TroubleshootingGuide.java\n    - Existing URL generation utility is sufficient.\n\nIntegration points and conventions:\n- The gson.pro file is applied by shrinkers automatically when the library is used, so changes there must be conservative, conditional, and not broadly keep consumer classes.\n- Troubleshooting.md uses section anchors referenced by code; preserve the r8-abstract-class anchor or adjust code if the anchor changes.\n- ConstructorConstructor’s messages are surfaced in various paths (UnsafeAllocator, ReflectiveTypeAdapterFactory); changes should maintain clarity and backward compatibility.\n\nImplementation Plan\n\n1) Default rules in META-INF/proguard/gson.pro\n- File: gson/src/main/resources/META-INF/proguard/gson.pro\n- Add rules that:\n  - Keep all constructors of classes that exhibit Gson usage via annotations. Implement conditional retention by:\n    - Adding rules that match classes having fields or types annotated with Gson annotations (SerializedName, Expose, JsonAdapter, Since, Until).\n    - For those matched classes, keep all constructors.\n  - Use -keepclasseswithmembers for these conditional matches to ensure the class is not made abstract and constructors are retained. Include the allowobfuscation modifier so class/member names may still be obfuscated if desired by users.\n  - Retain runtime-visible annotations and generic signatures where needed:\n    - Ensure keepattributes Signature is present for TypeToken generic handling.\n    - Ensure runtime annotations are preserved on matched classes (RuntimeVisibleAnnotations). For R8 “full mode” behavior where keepattributes only applies to kept classes, rely on the conditional -keepclasseswithmembers rules to match classes with Gson annotations, so attributes are preserved on those classes.\n  - Ensure the shipped rules do not broadly keep all user model classes; scope rules to those with Gson annotations so the default remains minimally invasive.\n\n2) Troubleshooting Guide improvements\n- File: Troubleshooting.md\n- Update section “JsonIOException: \'Abstract classes can\'t be instantiated!\' (R8)”:\n  - Replace the current example that only keeps the no-arg constructor with guidance to keep all constructors for the class mentioned in the error.\n  - Clarify when to use -keepclasseswithmembers vs -keepclassmembers:\n    - Recommend -keepclasseswithmembers with a constructor match to prevent R8 from making the class abstract and to keep constructors.\n    - Mention that -keep may be used if the user wants to unconditionally keep a specific class.\n  - Add Kotlin-specific guidance:\n    - Explain that Kotlin classes commonly lack a no-arg constructor and that keeping all constructors avoids issues.\n    - Note that using all-constructors retention may make Gson rely on JDK Unsafe for instantiation when no suitable constructor exists; advise making a no-arg constructor available if default field initialization is important; highlight GsonBuilder.disableJdkUnsafe() for early detection of missing constructors.\n  - Add an Android recommendation to use @Keep (either on the class or on the constructor) as a simpler alternative to shrinker configuration for users who control the source.\n  - Preserve the anchor id r8-abstract-class.\n- Update the TypeToken troubleshooting section to note that some rules are applied automatically via gson.pro but that project shrinker modes/configurations may still require explicit rules, and reference the Android example.\n- In the “Default field values missing” section, link to the guidance about constructors and Unsafe so the two points cross-reference each other.\n\n3) Android example README enhancements\n- File: examples/android-proguard-example/README.md\n- Expand the example to:\n  - Show a rule that conditionally keeps all constructors when Gson annotations are present on a class, and that includes allowobfuscation to minimize obfuscation impact.\n  - Highlight the @Keep alternative on classes/constructors and when to prefer it (e.g., if you own the model classes).\n  - Explain why keeping only a no-arg constructor can be insufficient for Kotlin classes, and when to add a no-arg constructor vs relying on Unsafe.\n  - Reiterate preserving generic signatures for TypeToken and preserving runtime annotations.\n  - Mention R8’s compatibility and differences vs ProGuard and why conditional rules are preferred.\n\n4) Error message behavior in ConstructorConstructor\n- File: gson/src/main/java/com/google/gson/internal/ConstructorConstructor.java\n- Method to change:\n  - checkInstantiable(Class<?> c)\n- Change:\n  - If the class is abstract, include the Troubleshooting Guide link unconditionally in the returned message. Remove the current condition that includes the link only when there are zero declared constructors.\n  - Keep the distinction in plain text that abstract classes cannot be instantiated and suggest registering an InstanceCreator or TypeAdapter for genuinely abstract types. The Troubleshooting Guide section should explicitly cover both cases (R8-induced abstractness vs genuinely abstract source).\n- Integration:\n  - This change ensures that, even if R8 leaves some constructor artifacts on an abstract class, users still see the URL that explains R8-related adjustments.\n  - Verify that other JsonIOException messages thrown through ObjectConstructor wrappers remain consistent with expectations and do not regress tests.\n\nConsiderations\n\n- Impact on existing functionality:\n  - The gson.pro changes only affect consumer classes that use Gson annotations; they do not broadly keep all classes. Using allowobfuscation on keep rules reduces the impact on obfuscation.\n  - ConstructorConstructor message changes affect the exact error text. Tests that assert message contents may need to be updated to expect the Troubleshooting Guide URL in more abstract-class paths.\n\n- Backward compatibility:\n  - Preserve Troubleshooting Guide anchors (e.g., r8-abstract-class) so existing links remain valid.\n  - Avoid broad keep rules in gson.pro that would alter consumers’ obfuscation patterns. Keep rules should be conditional and include allowobfuscation.\n  - Do not alter existing behavior of GsonBuilder.disableJdkUnsafe(); only the documentation references need adjusting.\n\n- Dependencies and prerequisites:\n  - R8 and ProGuard support the conditional matching required (e.g., -keepclasseswithmembers and, where used, -if semantics). Ensure the default rules use constructs supported by both tools; prefer -keepclasseswithmembers with constructor and annotation member patterns rather than relying solely on -if.\n  - Retaining runtime-visible annotations requires keepattributes RuntimeVisibleAnnotations; this typically applies only to classes matched by keep rules in R8 “full mode.” The conditional keep ensures attributes are retained on relevant classes.\n  - Some projects may not use any Gson annotations; the default rules cannot detect usage in that case. The Troubleshooting Guide should state that developers may still need to add explicit keep rules for specific classes that are deserialized without annotations.\n\nSummary of changes by file\n\n- gson/src/main/resources/META-INF/proguard/gson.pro\n  - Add conditional keep rules that match classes with Gson annotations and keep all constructors, with allowobfuscation.\n  - Ensure attributes for generic signatures and runtime annotations are preserved on matched classes.\n\n- Troubleshooting.md\n  - Update the R8 abstract class section to recommend keeping all constructors and clarify -keep vs -keepclasseswithmembers.\n  - Add Android @Keep recommendation and Kotlin constructor guidance.\n  - Cross-reference disableJdkUnsafe and TypeToken signature preservation.\n  - Maintain anchor IDs.\n\n- examples/android-proguard-example/README.md\n  - Include updated example rules and Android/Kotlin guidance.\n  - Explain rationale for allowobfuscation.\n\n- gson/src/main/java/com/google/gson/internal/ConstructorConstructor.java\n  - In checkInstantiable, always include the Troubleshooting Guide link on abstract-class failure messages, regardless of constructor presence.\n\nThese changes integrate default shrinker behavior with Gson usage patterns, improve developer guidance, and make error diagnostics more consistently actionable.\n--- END ANALYZER MESSAGE ---\n\nIMPORTANT INSTRUCTION:\n- The context provided above should be sufficient for you to make the required code edits.

This prevents Gson from creating instances. In some builds, R8 may retain synthetic or additional constructors even after making a class abstract, but instantiation will still fail.\\n\\n**Solution:** Prefer keeping all constructors of the affected class so R8 neither removes constructors nor changes abstractness when the rule applies.

Keeping all constructors avoids mismatches with rules that only keep `<init>()`. If you rely on constructor logic (initializers, default values), consider providing a no-args or secondary constructor that fits your deserialization needs.\\n- If no suitable constructor is available, Gson may fall back to JDK Unsafe to create instances without invoking constructors. To detect this early, use [`GsonBuilder.disableJdkUnsafe()`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.html#disableJdkUnsafe()).\\n- `-keepclasseswithmembers` keeps the class when the member pattern matches and retains the specified members.

-# Troubleshooting Guide
-
-This guide describes how to troubleshoot common issues when using Gson.

-
-## <a id="class-cast-exception"></a> `ClassCastException` when using deserialized object
-
-**Symptom:** `ClassCastException` is thrown when accessing an object deserialized by Gson
-
-**Reason:** Your code is most likely not type-safe
-
-**Solution:** Make sure your code adheres to the following:
-
-- Avoid raw types: Instead of calling `fromJson(..., List.class)`, create for example a `TypeToken<List<MyClass>>`.
-  See the [user guide](UserGuide.md#collections-examples) for more information.
-- When using `TypeToken` prefer the `Gson.fromJson` overloads with `TypeToken` parameter such as [`fromJson(Reader, TypeToken)`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/Gson.html#fromJson(java.io.Reader,com.google.gson.reflect.TypeToken)).
-  The overloads with `Type` parameter do not provide any type-safety guarantees.
-- When using `TypeToken` make sure you don't capture a type variable. For example avoid something like `new TypeToken<List<T>>()` (where `T` is a type variable). Due to Java type erasure the actual type of `T` is not available at runtime. Refactor your code to pass around `TypeToken` instances or use [`TypeToken.getParameterized(...)`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/reflect/TypeToken.html#getParameterized(java.lang.reflect.Type,java.lang.reflect.Type...)), for example `TypeToken.getParameterized(List.class, elementClass)`.
-
-## <a id="reflection-inaccessible"></a> `InaccessibleObjectException`: 'module ... does not "opens ..." to unnamed module'
-
-**Symptom:** An exception with a message in the form 'module ... does not "opens ..." to unnamed module' is thrown
-
-**Reason:** You use Gson by accident to access internal fields of third-party classes
-
-**Solution:** Write custom Gson [`TypeAdapter`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html) implementations for the affected classes or change the type of your data. If this occurs for a field in one of your classes which you did not actually want to serialize or deserialize in the first place, you can exclude that field, see the [user guide](UserGuide.md#excluding-fields-from-serialization-and-deserialization).
-
-**Explanation:**
-
-When no built-in adapter for a type exists and no custom adapter has been registered, Gson falls back to using reflection to access the fields of a class (including `private` ones). Most likely you are seeing this error because you (by accident) rely on the reflection-based adapter for third-party classes. That should be avoided because you make yourself dependent on the implementation details of these classes which could change at any point. For the JDK it is also not possible anymore to access internal fields using reflection starting with JDK 17, see [JEP 403](https://openjdk.org/jeps/403).
-
-If you want to prevent using reflection on third-party classes in the future you can write your own [`ReflectionAccessFilter`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/ReflectionAccessFilter.html) or use one of the predefined ones, such as `ReflectionAccessFilter.BLOCK_ALL_PLATFORM`.
-
-## <a id="reflection-inaccessible-to-module-gson"></a> `InaccessibleObjectException`: 'module ... does not "opens ..." to module com.google.gson'
-
-**Symptom:** An exception with a message in the form 'module ... does not "opens ..." to module com.google.gson' is thrown
-
-**Reason:**
-
-- If the reported package is your own package then you have not configured the module declaration of your project to allow Gson to use reflection on your classes.
-- If the reported package is from a third party library or the JDK see [this troubleshooting point](#inaccessibleobjectexception-module--does-not-opens--to-unnamed-module).
-
-**Solution:** Make sure the `module-info.java` file of your project allows Gson to use reflection on your classes, for example:
-
-```java
-module mymodule {
-    requires com.google.gson;
-
-    opens mypackage to com.google.gson;
-}
-```
-
-Or in case this occurs for a field in one of your classes which you did not actually want to serialize or deserialize in the first place, you can exclude that field, see the [user guide](UserGuide.md#excluding-fields-from-serialization-and-deserialization).
-
-## <a id="android-app-random-names"></a> Android app not working in Release mode; random property names
-
-**Symptom:** Your Android app is working fine in Debug mode but fails in Release mode and the JSON properties have seemingly random names such as `a`, `b`, ...
-
-**Reason:** You probably have not configured ProGuard / R8 correctly
-
-**Solution:** Make sure you have configured ProGuard / R8 correctly to preserve the names of your fields. See the [Android example](examples/android-proguard-example/README.md) for more information.
-
-## <a id="android-app-broken-after-app-update"></a> Android app unable to parse JSON after app update
-
-**Symptom:** You released a new version of your Android app and it fails to parse JSON data created by the previous version of your app
-
-**Reason:** You probably have not configured ProGuard / R8 correctly; probably the fields names are being obfuscated and their naming changed between the versions of your app
-
-**Solution:** Make sure you have configured ProGuard / R8 correctly to preserve the names of your fields. See the [Android example](examples/android-proguard-example/README.md) for more information.
-
-If you want to preserve backward compatibility for you app you can use [`@SerializedName`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/annotations/SerializedName.html) on the fields to specify the obfuscated name as alternate, for example: `@SerializedName(value = "myprop", alternate = "a")`
-
-Normally ProGuard and R8 produce a mapping file, this makes it easier to find out the obfuscated field names instead of having to find them out through trial and error or other means. See the [Android Studio user guide](https://developer.android.com/studio/build/shrink-code.html#retracing) for more information.
-
-## <a id="default-field-values-missing"></a> Default field values not present after deserialization
-
-**Symptom:** You have assign default values to fields but after deserialization the fields have their standard value (such as `null` or `0`)
-
-**Reason:** Gson cannot invoke the constructor of your class and falls back to JDK `Unsafe` (or similar means)
-
-**Solution:** Make sure that the class:
-
-- is `static` (explicitly or implicitly when it is a top-level class)
-- has a no-args constructor
-
-Otherwise Gson will by default try to use JDK `Unsafe` or similar means to create an instance of your class without invoking the constructor and without running any initializers. You can also disable that behavior through [`GsonBuilder.disableJdkUnsafe()`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.html#disableJdkUnsafe()) to notice such issues early on.
-
-## <a id="anonymous-local-null"></a> `null` values for anonymous and local classes
-
-**Symptom:** Objects of a class are always serialized as JSON `null` / always deserialized as Java `null`
-
-**Reason:** The class you are serializing or deserializing is an anonymous or a local class (or you have specified a custom `ExclusionStrategy`)
-
-**Solution:** Convert the class to a `static` nested class. If the class is already `static` make sure you have not specified a Gson `ExclusionStrategy` which might exclude the class.
-
-Notes:
-
-- "double brace-initialization" also creates anonymous classes
-- Local record classes (feature added in Java 16) are supported by Gson and are not affected by this
-
-## <a id="map-key-wrong-json"></a> Map keys having unexpected format in JSON
-
-**Symptom:** JSON output for `Map` keys is unexpected / cannot be deserialized again
-
-**Reason:** The `Map` key type is 'complex' and you have not configured the `GsonBuilder` properly
-
-**Solution:** Use [`GsonBuilder.enableComplexMapKeySerialization()`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.html#enableComplexMapKeySerialization()). See also the [user guide](UserGuide.md#maps-examples) for more information.
-
-## <a id="malformed-json"></a> Parsing JSON fails with `MalformedJsonException`
-
-**Symptom:** JSON parsing fails with `MalformedJsonException`
-
-**Reason:** The JSON data is actually malformed
-
-**Solution:** During debugging, log the JSON data right before calling Gson methods or set a breakpoint to inspect the data and make sure it has the expected format. Sometimes APIs might return HTML error pages (instead of JSON data) when reaching rate limits or when other errors occur. Also read the location information of the `MalformedJsonException` exception message, it indicates where exactly in the document the malformed data was detected, including the [JSONPath](https://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/).
-
-For example, let's assume you want to deserialize the following JSON data:
-
-```json
-{
-  "languages": [
-    "English",
-    "French",
-  ]
-}
-```
-
-This will fail with an exception similar to this one: `MalformedJsonException: Use JsonReader.setLenient(true) to accept malformed JSON at line 5 column 4 path $.languages[2]`  
-The problem here is the trailing comma (`,`) after `"French"`, trailing commas are not allowed by the JSON specification. The location information "line 5 column 4" points to the `]` in the JSON data (with some slight inaccuracies) because Gson expected another value after `,` instead of the closing `]`. The JSONPath `$.languages[2]` in the exception message also points there: `$.` refers to the root object, `languages` refers to its member of that name and `[2]` refers to the (missing) third value in the JSON array value of that member (numbering starts at 0, so it is `[2]` instead of `[3]`).  
-The proper solution here is to fix the malformed JSON data.
-
-To spot syntax errors in the JSON data easily you can open it in an editor with support for JSON, for example Visual Studio Code. It will highlight within the JSON data the error location and show why the JSON data is considered invalid.
-
-## <a id="number-parsed-as-double"></a> Integral JSON number is parsed as `double`
-
-**Symptom:** JSON data contains an integral number such as `45` but Gson returns it as `double`
-
-**Reason:** When parsing a JSON number as `Object`, Gson will by default create always return a `double`
-
-**Solution:** Use [`GsonBuilder.setObjectToNumberStrategy`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.html#setObjectToNumberStrategy(com.google.gson.ToNumberStrategy)) to specify what type of number should be returned
-
-## <a id="default-lenient"></a> Malformed JSON not rejected
-
-**Symptom:** Gson parses malformed JSON without throwing any exceptions
-
-**Reason:** Due to legacy reasons Gson performs parsing by default in lenient mode
-
-**Solution:** See [`Gson` class documentation](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/Gson.html#default-lenient) section "Lenient JSON handling"
-
-Note: Even in non-lenient mode Gson deviates slightly from the JSON specification, see [`JsonReader.setLenient`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/stream/JsonReader.html#setLenient(boolean)) for more details.
-
-## <a id="unexpected-json-structure"></a> `IllegalStateException`: "Expected ... but was ..."
-
-**Symptom:** An `IllegalStateException` with a message in the form "Expected ... but was ..." is thrown
-
-**Reason:** The JSON data does not have the correct format
-
-**Solution:** Make sure that your classes correctly model the JSON data. Also during debugging log the JSON data right before calling Gson methods or set a breakpoint to inspect the data and make sure it has the expected format. Read the location information of the exception message, it indicates where exactly in the document the error occurred, including the [JSONPath](https://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/).
-
-For example, let's assume you have the following Java class:
-
-```java
-class WebPage {
-    String languages;
-}
-```
-
-And you want to deserialize the following JSON data:
-
-```json
-{
-  "languages": ["English", "French"]
-}
-```
-
-This will fail with an exception similar to this one: `IllegalStateException: Expected a string but was BEGIN_ARRAY at line 2 column 17 path $.languages`  
-This means Gson expected a JSON string value but found the beginning of a JSON array (`[`). The location information "line 2 column 17" points to the `[` in the JSON data (with some slight inaccuracies), so does the JSONPath `$.languages` in the exception message. It refers to the `languages` member of the root object (`$.`).  
-The solution here is to change in the `WebPage` class the field `String languages` to `List<String> languages`.
-
-## <a id="adapter-not-null-safe"></a> `IllegalStateException`: "Expected ... but was NULL"
-
-**Symptom:** An `IllegalStateException` with a message in the form "Expected ... but was NULL" is thrown
-
-**Reason:**
-
-- A built-in adapter does not support JSON null values
-- You have written a custom `TypeAdapter` which does not properly handle JSON null values
-
-**Solution:** If this occurs for a custom adapter you wrote, add code similar to the following at the beginning of its `read` method:
-
-```java
-@Override
-public MyClass read(JsonReader in) throws IOException {
-    if (in.peek() == JsonToken.NULL) {
-        in.nextNull();
-        return null;
-    }
-
-    ...
-}
-```
-
-Alternatively you can call [`nullSafe()`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html#nullSafe()) on the adapter instance you created.
-
-## <a id="serialize-nulls"></a> Properties missing in JSON
-
-**Symptom:** Properties are missing in the JSON output
-
-**Reason:** Gson by default omits JSON null from the output (or: ProGuard / R8 is not configured correctly and removed unused fields)
-
-**Solution:** Use [`GsonBuilder.serializeNulls()`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.html#serializeNulls())
-
-Note: Gson does not support anonymous and local classes and will serialize them as JSON null, see the [related troubleshooting point](#null-values-for-anonymous-and-local-classes).
-
-## <a id="android-internal-fields"></a> JSON output changes for newer Android versions
-
-**Symptom:** The JSON output differs when running on newer Android versions
-
-**Reason:** You use Gson by accident to access internal fields of Android classes
-
-**Solution:** Write custom Gson [`TypeAdapter`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html) implementations for the affected classes or change the type of your data
-
-**Explanation:**
-
-When no built-in adapter for a type exists and no custom adapter has been registered, Gson falls back to using reflection to access the fields of a class (including `private` ones). Most likely you are experiencing this issue because you (by accident) rely on the reflection-based adapter for Android classes. That should be avoided because you make yourself dependent on the implementation details of these classes which could change at any point.
-
-If you want to prevent using reflection on third-party classes in the future you can write your own [`ReflectionAccessFilter`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/ReflectionAccessFilter.html) or use one of the predefined ones, such as `ReflectionAccessFilter.BLOCK_ALL_PLATFORM`.
-
-## <a id="json-static-fields"></a> JSON output contains values of `static` fields
-
-**Symptom:** The JSON output contains values of `static` fields
-
-**Reason:** You used `GsonBuilder.excludeFieldsWithModifiers` to overwrite the default excluded modifiers
-
-**Solution:** When calling `GsonBuilder.excludeFieldsWithModifiers` you overwrite the default excluded modifiers. Therefore, you have to explicitly exclude `static` fields if desired. This can be done by adding `Modifier.STATIC` as additional argument.
-
-## <a id="no-such-method-error"></a> `NoSuchMethodError` when calling Gson methods
-
-**Symptom:** A `java.lang.NoSuchMethodError` is thrown when trying to call certain Gson methods
-
-**Reason:**
-
-- You have multiple versions of Gson on your classpath
-- Or, the Gson version you compiled against is different from the one on your classpath
-- Or, you are using a code shrinking tool such as ProGuard or R8 which removed methods from Gson
-
-**Solution:** First disable any code shrinking tools such as ProGuard or R8 and check if the issue persists. If not, you have to tweak the configuration of that tool to not modify Gson classes. Otherwise verify that the Gson JAR on your classpath is the same you are compiling against, and that there is only one Gson JAR on your classpath. See [this Stack Overflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/q/227486) to find out where a class is loaded from. For example, for debugging you could include the following code:
-
-```java
-System.out.println(Gson.class.getProtectionDomain().getCodeSource().getLocation());
-```
-
-If that fails with a `NullPointerException` you have to try one of the other ways to find out where a class is loaded from.
-
-## <a id="duplicate-fields"></a> `IllegalArgumentException`: 'Class ... declares multiple JSON fields named '...''
-
-**Symptom:** An exception with the message 'Class ... declares multiple JSON fields named '...'' is thrown
-
-**Reason:**
-
-- The name you have specified with a [`@SerializedName`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/annotations/SerializedName.html) annotation for a field collides with the name of another field
-- The [`FieldNamingStrategy`](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/FieldNamingStrategy.html) you have specified produces conflicting field names
-- A field of your class has the same name as the field of a superclass
-
-Gson prevents multiple fields with the same name because during deserialization it would be ambiguous for which field the JSON data should be deserialized. For serialization it would cause the same field to appear multiple times in JSON. While the JSON specification permits this, it is likely that the application parsing the JSON data will not handle it correctly.
-
-**Solution:** First identify the fields with conflicting names based on the exception message. Then decide if you want to rename one of them using the [`@SerializedName`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/annotations/SerializedName.html) annotation, or if you want to [exclude](UserGuide.md#excluding-fields-from-serialization-and-deserialization) one of them. When excluding one of the fields you have to include it for both serialization and deserialization (even if your application only performs one of these actions) because the duplicate field check cannot differentiate between these actions.
-
-## <a id="java-lang-class-unsupported"></a> `UnsupportedOperationException` when serializing or deserializing `java.lang.Class`
-
-**Symptom:** An `UnsupportedOperationException` is thrown when trying to serialize or deserialize `java.lang.Class`
-
-**Reason:** Gson intentionally does not permit serializing and deserializing `java.lang.Class` for security reasons. Otherwise a malicious user could make your application load an arbitrary class from the classpath and, depending on what your application does with the `Class`, in the worst case perform a remote code execution attack.
-
-**Solution:** First check if you really need to serialize or deserialize a `Class`. Often it is possible to use string aliases and then map them to the known `Class`; you could write a custom [`TypeAdapter`](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html) to do this. If the `Class` values are not known in advance, try to introduce a common base class or interface for all these classes and then verify that the deserialized class is a subclass. For example assuming the base class is called `MyBaseClass`, your custom `TypeAdapter` should load the class like this:
-
-```java
-Class.forName(jsonString, false, getClass().getClassLoader()).asSubclass(MyBaseClass.class)
-```
-
-This will not initialize arbitrary classes, and it will throw a `ClassCastException` if the loaded class is not the same as or a subclass of `MyBaseClass`.
-
-## <a id="type-token-raw"></a> `IllegalStateException`: 'TypeToken must be created with a type argument' <br> `RuntimeException`: 'Missing type parameter'
-
-**Symptom:** An `IllegalStateException` with the message 'TypeToken must be created with a type argument' is thrown.  
-For older Gson versions a `RuntimeException` with message 'Missing type parameter' is thrown.
-
-**Reason:**
-
-- You created a `TypeToken` without type argument, for example `new TypeToken() {}` (note the missing `<...>`). You always have to provide the type argument, for example like this: `new TypeToken<List<String>>() {}`. Normally the compiler will also emit a 'raw types' warning when you forget the `<...>`.
-- You are using a code shrinking tool such as ProGuard or R8 (Android app builds normally have this enabled by default) but have not configured it correctly for usage with Gson.
-
-**Solution:** When you are using a code shrinking tool such as ProGuard or R8 you have to adjust your configuration to include the following rules:
-
-```
-# Keep generic signatures; needed for correct type resolution
--keepattributes Signature
-
-# Keep class TypeToken (respectively its generic signature)
--keep class com.google.gson.reflect.TypeToken { *; }
-
-# Keep any (anonymous) classes extending TypeToken
--keep class * extends com.google.gson.reflect.TypeToken
-```
-
-See also the [Android example](examples/android-proguard-example/README.md) for more information.
-
-Note: For newer Gson versions these rules might be applied automatically; make sure you are using the latest Gson version and the latest version of the code shrinking tool.

-## <a id="r8-abstract-class"></a> `JsonIOException`: 'Abstract classes can't be instantiated!' (R8)
-
-**Symptom:** A `JsonIOException` with the message 'Abstract classes can't be instantiated!' is thrown; the class mentioned in the exception message is not actually `abstract` in your source code, and you are using the code shrinking tool R8 (Android app builds normally have this configured by default).
-
-**Reason:** The code shrinking tool R8 performs optimizations where it removes the no-args constructor from a class and makes the class `abstract`. Due to this Gson cannot create an instance of the class.
-
-**Solution:** Make sure the class has a no-args constructor, then adjust your R8 configuration file to keep the constructor of the class. For example:
-
-```
-# Keep the no-args constructor of the deserialized class
--keepclassmembers class com.example.MyClass {
-  <init>();
-}
-```
-
-For Android you can add this rule to the `proguard-rules.pro` file, see also the [Android documentation](https://developer.android.com/build/shrink-code#keep-code). In case the class name in the exception message is obfuscated, see the Android documentation about [retracing](https://developer.android.com/build/shrink-code#retracing).
-
-Note: If the class which you are trying to deserialize is actually abstract, then this exception is probably unrelated to R8 and you will have to implement a custom [`InstanceCreator`](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/InstanceCreator.html) or [`TypeAdapter`](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html) which creates an instance of a non-abstract subclass of the class.

+
+## <a id="class-cast-exception"></a> `ClassCastException` when using deserialized object
+
+**Symptom:** `ClassCastException` is thrown when accessing an object deserialized by Gson
+
+**Reason:** Your code is most likely not type-safe
+
+**Solution:** Make sure your code adheres to the following:
+
+- Avoid raw types: Instead of calling `fromJson(..., List.class)`, create for example a `TypeToken<List<MyClass>>`.
+  See the [user guide](UserGuide.md#collections-examples) for more information.
+- When using `TypeToken` prefer the `Gson.fromJson` overloads with `TypeToken` parameter such as [`fromJson(Reader, TypeToken)`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/Gson.html#fromJson(java.io.Reader,com.google.gson.reflect.TypeToken)).
+  The overloads with `Type` parameter do not provide any type-safety guarantees.
+- When using `TypeToken` make sure you don't capture a type variable. For example avoid something like `new TypeToken<List<T>>()` (where `T` is a type variable). Due to Java type erasure the actual type of `T` is not available at runtime. Refactor your code to pass around `TypeToken` instances or use [`TypeToken.getParameterized(...)`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/reflect/TypeToken.html#getParameterized(java.lang.reflect.Type,java.lang.reflect.Type...)), for example `TypeToken.getParameterized(List.class, elementClass)`.
+
+## <a id="reflection-inaccessible"></a> `InaccessibleObjectException`: 'module ... does not "opens ..." to unnamed module'
+
+**Symptom:** An exception with a message in the form 'module ... does not "opens ..." to unnamed module' is thrown
+
+**Reason:** You use Gson by accident to access internal fields of third-party classes
+
+**Solution:** Write custom Gson [`TypeAdapter`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html) implementations for the affected classes or change the type of your data. If this occurs for a field in one of your classes which you did not actually want to serialize or deserialize in the first place, you can exclude that field, see the [user guide](UserGuide.md#excluding-fields-from-serialization-and-deserialization).
+
+**Explanation:**
+
+When no built-in adapter for a type exists and no custom adapter has been registered, Gson falls back to using reflection to access the fields of a class (including `private` ones). Most likely you are seeing this error because you (by accident) rely on the reflection-based adapter for third-party classes. That should be avoided because you make yourself dependent on the implementation details of these classes which could change at any point. For the JDK it is also not possible anymore to access internal fields using reflection starting with JDK 17, see [JEP 403](https://openjdk.org/jeps/403).
+
+If you want to prevent using reflection on third-party classes in the future you can write your own [`ReflectionAccessFilter`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/ReflectionAccessFilter.html) or use one of the predefined ones, such as `ReflectionAccessFilter.BLOCK_ALL_PLATFORM`.
+
+## <a id="reflection-inaccessible-to-module-gson"></a> `InaccessibleObjectException`: 'module ... does not "opens ..." to module com.google.gson'
+
+**Symptom:** An exception with a message in the form 'module ... does not "opens ..." to module com.google.gson' is thrown
+
+**Reason:**
+
+- If the reported package is your own package then you have not configured the module declaration of your project to allow Gson to use reflection on your classes.
+- If the reported package is from a third party library or the JDK see [this troubleshooting point](#inaccessibleobjectexception-module--does-not-opens--to-unnamed-module).
+
+**Solution:** Make sure the `module-info.java` file of your project allows Gson to use reflection on your classes, for example:
+
+```java
+module mymodule {
+    requires com.google.gson;
+
+    opens mypackage to com.google.gson;
+}
+```
+
+Or in case this occurs for a field in one of your classes which you did not actually want to serialize or deserialize in the first place, you can exclude that field, see the [user guide](UserGuide.md#excluding-fields-from-serialization-and-deserialization).
+
+## <a id="android-app-random-names"></a> Android app not working in Release mode; random property names
+
+**Symptom:** Your Android app is working fine in Debug mode but fails in Release mode and the JSON properties have seemingly random names such as `a`, `b`, ...
+
+**Reason:** You probably have not configured ProGuard / R8 correctly
+
+**Solution:** Make sure you have configured ProGuard / R8 correctly to preserve the names of your fields. See the [Android example](examples/android-proguard-example/README.md) for more information.
+
+## <a id="android-app-broken-after-app-update"></a> Android app unable to parse JSON after app update
+
+**Symptom:** You released a new version of your Android app and it fails to parse JSON data created by the previous version of your app
+
+**Reason:** You probably have not configured ProGuard / R8 correctly; probably the fields names are being obfuscated and their naming changed between the versions of your app
+
+**Solution:** Make sure you have configured ProGuard / R8 correctly to preserve the names of your fields. See the [Android example](examples/android-proguard-example/README.md) for more information.
+
+If you want to preserve backward compatibility for you app you can use [`@SerializedName`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/annotations/SerializedName.html) on the fields to specify the obfuscated name as alternate, for example: `@SerializedName(value = "myprop", alternate = "a")`
+
+Normally ProGuard and R8 produce a mapping file, this makes it easier to find out the obfuscated field names instead of having to find them out through trial and error or other means. See the [Android Studio user guide](https://developer.android.com/studio/build/shrink-code.html#retracing) for more information.
+
+## <a id="default-field-values-missing"></a> Default field values not present after deserialization
+
+**Symptom:** You have assign default values to fields but after deserialization the fields have their standard value (such as `null` or `0`)
+
+**Reason:** Gson cannot invoke the constructor of your class and falls back to JDK `Unsafe` (or similar means)
+
+**Solution:** Make sure that the class:
+
+- is `static` (explicitly or implicitly when it is a top-level class)
+- has a no-args constructor
+
+Otherwise Gson will by default try to use JDK `Unsafe` or similar means to create an instance of your class without invoking the constructor and without running any initializers. You can also disable that behavior through [`GsonBuilder.disableJdkUnsafe()`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.html#disableJdkUnsafe()) to notice such issues early on.
+
+## <a id="anonymous-local-null"></a> `null` values for anonymous and local classes
+
+**Symptom:** Objects of a class are always serialized as JSON `null` / always deserialized as Java `null`
+
+**Reason:** The class you are serializing or deserializing is an anonymous or a local class (or you have specified a custom `ExclusionStrategy`)
+
+**Solution:** Convert the class to a `static` nested class. If the class is already `static` make sure you have not specified a Gson `ExclusionStrategy` which might exclude the class.
+
+Notes:
+
+- "double brace-initialization" also creates anonymous classes
+- Local record classes (feature added in Java 16) are supported by Gson and are not affected by this
+
+## <a id="map-key-wrong-json"></a> Map keys having unexpected format in JSON
+
+**Symptom:** JSON output for `Map` keys is unexpected / cannot be deserialized again
+
+**Reason:** The `Map` key type is 'complex' and you have not configured the `GsonBuilder` properly
+
+**Solution:** Use [`GsonBuilder.enableComplexMapKeySerialization()`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.html#enableComplexMapKeySerialization()). See also the [user guide](UserGuide.md#maps-examples) for more information.
+
+## <a id="malformed-json"></a> Parsing JSON fails with `MalformedJsonException`
+
+**Symptom:** JSON parsing fails with `MalformedJsonException`
+
+**Reason:** The JSON data is actually malformed
+
+**Solution:** During debugging, log the JSON data right before calling Gson methods or set a breakpoint to inspect the data and make sure it has the expected format. Sometimes APIs might return HTML error pages (instead of JSON data) when reaching rate limits or when other errors occur. Also read the location information of the `MalformedJsonException` exception message, it indicates where exactly in the document the malformed data was detected, including the [JSONPath](https://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/).
+
+For example, let's assume you want to deserialize the following JSON data:
+
+```json
+{
+  "languages": [
+    "English",
+    "French",
+  ]
+}
+```
+
+This will fail with an exception similar to this one: `MalformedJsonException: Use JsonReader.setLenient(true) to accept malformed JSON at line 5 column 4 path $.languages[2]`  
+The problem here is the trailing comma (`,`) after `"French"`, trailing commas are not allowed by the JSON specification. The location information "line 5 column 4" points to the `]` in the JSON data (with some slight inaccuracies) because Gson expected another value after `,` instead of the closing `]`. The JSONPath `$.languages[2]` in the exception message also points there: `$.` refers to the root object, `languages` refers to its member of that name and `[2]` refers to the (missing) third value in the JSON array value of that member (numbering starts at 0, so it is `[2]` instead of `[3]`).  
+The proper solution here is to fix the malformed JSON data.
+
+To spot syntax errors in the JSON data easily you can open it in an editor with support for JSON, for example Visual Studio Code. It will highlight within the JSON data the error location and show why the JSON data is considered invalid.
+
+## <a id="number-parsed-as-double"></a> Integral JSON number is parsed as `double`
+
+**Symptom:** JSON data contains an integral number such as `45` but Gson returns it as `double`
+
+**Reason:** When parsing a JSON number as `Object`, Gson will by default create always return a `double`
+
+**Solution:** Use [`GsonBuilder.setObjectToNumberStrategy`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.html#setObjectToNumberStrategy(com.google.gson.ToNumberStrategy)) to specify what type of number should be returned
+
+## <a id="default-lenient"></a> Malformed JSON not rejected
+
+**Symptom:** Gson parses malformed JSON without throwing any exceptions
+
+**Reason:** Due to legacy reasons Gson performs parsing by default in lenient mode
+
+**Solution:** See [`Gson` class documentation](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/Gson.html#default-lenient) section "Lenient JSON handling"
+
+Note: Even in non-lenient mode Gson deviates slightly from the JSON specification, see [`JsonReader.setLenient`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/stream/JsonReader.html#setLenient(boolean)) for more details.
+
+## <a id="unexpected-json-structure"></a> `IllegalStateException`: "Expected ... but was ..."
+
+**Symptom:** An `IllegalStateException` with a message in the form "Expected ... but was ..." is thrown
+
+**Reason:** The JSON data does not have the correct format
+
+**Solution:** Make sure that your classes correctly model the JSON data. Also during debugging log the JSON data right before calling Gson methods or set a breakpoint to inspect the data and make sure it has the expected format. Read the location information of the exception message, it indicates where exactly in the document the error occurred, including the [JSONPath](https://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/).
+
+For example, let's assume you have the following Java class:
+
+```java
+class WebPage {
+    String languages;
+}
+```
+
+And you want to deserialize the following JSON data:
+
+```json
+{
+  "languages": ["English", "French"]
+}
+```
+
+This will fail with an exception similar to this one: `IllegalStateException: Expected a string but was BEGIN_ARRAY at line 2 column 17 path $.languages`  
+This means Gson expected a JSON string value but found the beginning of a JSON array (`[`). The location information "line 2 column 17" points to the `[` in the JSON data (with some slight inaccuracies), so does the JSONPath `$.languages` in the exception message. It refers to the `languages` member of the root object (`$.`).  
+The solution here is to change in the `WebPage` class the field `String languages` to `List<String> languages`.
+
+## <a id="adapter-not-null-safe"></a> `IllegalStateException`: "Expected ... but was NULL"
+
+**Symptom:** An `IllegalStateException` with a message in the form "Expected ... but was NULL" is thrown
+
+**Reason:**
+
+- A built-in adapter does not support JSON null values
+- You have written a custom `TypeAdapter` which does not properly handle JSON null values
+
+**Solution:** If this occurs for a custom adapter you wrote, add code similar to the following at the beginning of its `read` method:
+
+```java
+@Override
+public MyClass read(JsonReader in) throws IOException {
+    if (in.peek() == JsonToken.NULL) {
+        in.nextNull();
+        return null;
+    }
+
+    ...
+}
+```
+
+Alternatively you can call [`nullSafe()`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html#nullSafe()) on the adapter instance you created.
+
+## <a id="serialize-nulls"></a> Properties missing in JSON
+
+**Symptom:** Properties are missing in the JSON output
+
+**Reason:** Gson by default omits JSON null from the output (or: ProGuard / R8 is not configured correctly and removed unused fields)
+
+**Solution:** Use [`GsonBuilder.serializeNulls()`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.html#serializeNulls())
+
+Note: Gson does not support anonymous and local classes and will serialize them as JSON null, see the [related troubleshooting point](#null-values-for-anonymous-and-local-classes).
+
+## <a id="android-internal-fields"></a> JSON output changes for newer Android versions
+
+**Symptom:** The JSON output differs when running on newer Android versions
+
+**Reason:** You use Gson by accident to access internal fields of Android classes
+
+**Solution:** Write custom Gson [`TypeAdapter`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html) implementations for the affected classes or change the type of your data
+
+**Explanation:**
+
+When no built-in adapter for a type exists and no custom adapter has been registered, Gson falls back to using reflection to access the fields of a class (including `private` ones). Most likely you are experiencing this issue because you (by accident) rely on the reflection-based adapter for Android classes. That should be avoided because you make yourself dependent on the implementation details of these classes which could change at any point.
+
+If you want to prevent using reflection on third-party classes in the future you can write your own [`ReflectionAccessFilter`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/ReflectionAccessFilter.html) or use one of the predefined ones, such as `ReflectionAccessFilter.BLOCK_ALL_PLATFORM`.
+
+## <a id="json-static-fields"></a> JSON output contains values of `static` fields
+
+**Symptom:** The JSON output contains values of `static` fields
+
+**Reason:** You used `GsonBuilder.excludeFieldsWithModifiers` to overwrite the default excluded modifiers
+
+**Solution:** When calling `GsonBuilder.excludeFieldsWithModifiers` you overwrite the default excluded modifiers. Therefore, you have to explicitly exclude `static` fields if desired. This can be done by adding `Modifier.STATIC` as additional argument.
+
+## <a id="no-such-method-error"></a> `NoSuchMethodError` when calling Gson methods
+
+**Symptom:** A `java.lang.NoSuchMethodError` is thrown when trying to call certain Gson methods
+
+**Reason:**
+
+- You have multiple versions of Gson on your classpath
+- Or, the Gson version you compiled against is different from the one on your classpath
+- Or, you are using a code shrinking tool such as ProGuard or R8 which removed methods from Gson
+
+**Solution:** First disable any code shrinking tools such as ProGuard or R8 and check if the issue persists. If not, you have to tweak the configuration of that tool to not modify Gson classes. Otherwise verify that the Gson JAR on your classpath is the same you are compiling against, and that there is only one Gson JAR on your classpath. See [this Stack Overflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/q/227486) to find out where a class is loaded from. For example, for debugging you could include the following code:
+
+```java
+System.out.println(Gson.class.getProtectionDomain().getCodeSource().getLocation());
+```
+
+If that fails with a `NullPointerException` you have to try one of the other ways to find out where a class is loaded from.
+
+## <a id="duplicate-fields"></a> `IllegalArgumentException`: 'Class ... declares multiple JSON fields named '...''
+
+**Symptom:** An exception with the message 'Class ... declares multiple JSON fields named '...'' is thrown
+
+**Reason:**
+
+- The name you have specified with a [`@SerializedName`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/annotations/SerializedName.html) annotation for a field collides with the name of another field
+- The [`FieldNamingStrategy`](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/FieldNamingStrategy.html) you have specified produces conflicting field names
+- A field of your class has the same name as the field of a superclass
+
+Gson prevents multiple fields with the same name because during deserialization it would be ambiguous for which field the JSON data should be deserialized. For serialization it would cause the same field to appear multiple times in JSON. While the JSON specification permits this, it is likely that the application parsing the JSON data will not handle it correctly.
+
+**Solution:** First identify the fields with conflicting names based on the exception message. Then decide if you want to rename one of them using the [`@SerializedName`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/annotations/SerializedName.html) annotation, or if you want to [exclude](UserGuide.md#excluding-fields-from-serialization-and-deserialization) one of them. When excluding one of the fields you have to include it for both serialization and deserialization (even if your application only performs one of these actions) because the duplicate field check cannot differentiate between these actions.
+
+## <a id="java-lang-class-unsupported"></a> `UnsupportedOperationException` when serializing or deserializing `java.lang.Class`
+
+**Symptom:** An `UnsupportedOperationException` is thrown when trying to serialize or deserialize `java.lang.Class`
+
+**Reason:** Gson intentionally does not permit serializing and deserializing `java.lang.Class` for security reasons. Otherwise a malicious user could make your application load an arbitrary class from the classpath and, depending on what your application does with the `Class`, in the worst case perform a remote code execution attack.
+
+**Solution:** First check if you really need to serialize or deserialize a `Class`. Often it is possible to use string aliases and then map them to the known `Class`; you could write a custom [`TypeAdapter`](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html) to do this. If the `Class` values are not known in advance, try to introduce a common base class or interface for all these classes and then verify that the deserialized class is a subclass. For example assuming the base class is called `MyBaseClass`, your custom `TypeAdapter` should load the class like this:
+
+```java
+Class.forName(jsonString, false, getClass().getClassLoader()).asSubclass(MyBaseClass.class)
+```
+
+This will not initialize arbitrary classes, and it will throw a `ClassCastException` if the loaded class is not the same as or a subclass of `MyBaseClass`.
+
+## <a id="type-token-raw"></a> `IllegalStateException`: 'TypeToken must be created with a type argument' <br> `RuntimeException`: 'Missing type parameter'
+
+**Symptom:** An `IllegalStateException` with the message 'TypeToken must be created with a type argument' is thrown.  
+For older Gson versions a `RuntimeException` with message 'Missing type parameter' is thrown.
+
+**Reason:**
+
+- You created a `TypeToken` without type argument, for example `new TypeToken() {}` (note the missing `<...>`). You always have to provide the type argument, for example like this: `new TypeToken<List<String>>() {}`. Normally the compiler will also emit a 'raw types' warning when you forget the `<...>`.
+- You are using a code shrinking tool such as ProGuard or R8 (Android app builds normally have this enabled by default) but have not configured it correctly for usage with Gson.
+
+**Solution:** When you are using a code shrinking tool such as ProGuard or R8 you have to adjust your configuration to include the following rules:
+
+```
+# Keep generic signatures; needed for correct type resolution
+-keepattributes Signature
+
+# Keep class TypeToken (respectively its generic signature)
+-keep class com.google.gson.reflect.TypeToken { *; }
+
+# Keep any (anonymous) classes extending TypeToken
+-keep class * extends com.google.gson.reflect.TypeToken
+```
+
+See also the [Android example](examples/android-proguard-example/README.md) for more information.
+
+Note: For newer Gson versions these rules might be applied automatically; make sure you are using the latest Gson version and the latest version of the code shrinking tool.
+
+## <a id="r8-abstract-class"></a> `JsonIOException`: 'Abstract classes can't be instantiated!' (R8)
+
+**Symptom:** A `JsonIOException` with the message 'Abstract classes can't be instantiated!' is thrown; the class mentioned in the exception message is not actually `abstract` in your source code, and you are using the code shrinking tool R8 (Android app builds normally have this configured by default).
+
+**Reason:** R8 can remove constructors and, in some optimizations, make classes `abstract`. This prevents Gson from creating instances. In some builds, R8 may retain synthetic or additional constructors even after making a class abstract, but instantiation will still fail.
+
+**Solution:** Prefer keeping all constructors of the affected class so R8 neither removes constructors nor changes abstractness when the rule applies. For example:
+
+```
+# Keep all constructors of the deserialized class and keep the class when the rule matches
+-keepclasseswithmembers class com.example.MyClass {
+  <init>(...);
+}
+```
+
+Notes and alternatives:
+
+- Kotlin classes commonly do not have a no-args constructor (for example `class MyClass(val s: String)`). Keeping all constructors avoids mismatches with rules that only keep `<init>()`. If you rely on constructor logic (initializers, default values), consider providing a no-args or secondary constructor that fits your deserialization needs.
+- If no suitable constructor is available, Gson may fall back to JDK Unsafe to create instances without invoking constructors. To detect this early, use [`GsonBuilder.disableJdkUnsafe()`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.html#disableJdkUnsafe()).
+- `-keepclasseswithmembers` keeps the class when the member pattern matches and retains the specified members. Compared to `-keepclassmembers`, it also prevents R8 from changing the class abstractness when the rule applies. If you want to unconditionally keep a class (and all its members), you can use `-keep class com.example.MyClass`.
+- As an Android-friendly alternative, annotate your model class or its constructor with `@Keep` to prevent removal by the shrinker. See the [Android documentation](https://developer.android.com/studio/write/annotations#keep).
+- Newer Gson versions ship default ProGuard/R8 rules that help retain constructors when Gson annotations are present on a class (see `gson/META-INF/proguard/gson.pro` in the JAR). If your class does not use Gson annotations, you may still need an explicit rule or `@Keep`.
+
+For Android you can add these rules to the `proguard-rules.pro` file, see also the [Android documentation](https://developer.android.com/build/shrink-code#keep-code). In case the class name in the exception message is obfuscated, see the Android documentation about [retracing](https://developer.android.com/build/shrink-code#retracing).
+
+Note: If the class which you are trying to deserialize is actually abstract, then this exception is unrelated to R8 and you will have to implement a custom [`InstanceCreator`](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/InstanceCreator.html) or [`TypeAdapter`](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html) which creates an instance of a non-abstract subclass of the class.

+- Kotlin classes often do not have a no-args constructor. Keeping all constructors avoids issues with rules that only keep `<init>()`. If you rely on constructor logic or default property values, consider adding a suitable constructor for deserialization.
+- As an alternative to shrinker rules, annotate classes or constructors with Android's `@Keep` to prevent removal by ProGuard/R8. See the [Android documentation](https://developer.android.com/studio/write/annotations#keep).
+- Ensure generic signatures are preserved when using `TypeToken`, and retain runtime-visible annotations where they influence Gson behavior. The shipped `gson.pro` covers common cases, but project-specific rules may still be required.

content='I am going to share details about a feature request reported to a codebase and its related context.\nPlease analyze this feature request and provide a high-level description of what needs to be implemented:\n\n1. Feature Understanding:\n- Analyze the feature request title, description, and comments provided\n- Identify the desired functionality and requirements\n- Clarify any ambiguities or edge cases\n\n2. Architecture Analysis:\n- Identify which files, modules, or components need to be created or modified\n- Determine how this feature integrates with existing code\n- Consider architectural patterns and conventions from the codebase\n\n3. Implementation Plan:\nFor each needed change, describe in plain English:\n- Which file needs to be created or modified\n- Which classes, functions, or code blocks need to be added or changed\n- What needs to be implemented (e.g., "add new method to handle X", "create new service class for Y")\n- How this integrates with existing components\n\n4. Considerations:\n- Identify potential impacts on existing functionality\n- Consider backward compatibility\n- Note any dependencies or prerequisites\n\nDo NOT provide actual code snippets or diffs. Focus on describing what needs to be implemented.\n\nHere are the details for analysis:\n\nIssue title:\nImprove default ProGuard / R8 rules and Troubleshooting Guide\n\nIssue description: \n# Problem solved by the feature\nImprove the default ProGuard / R8 rules in `META-INF/proguard/gson.pro` added by #2397, and the Troubleshooting Guide.\n\n# Feature description\nI was testing the new default rules with an Android app and Kotlin classes, and there might be the following areas to improve.\n\n### Troubleshooting Guide: `JsonIOException`: \'Abstract classes can\'t be instantiated!\' (R8)\n\nThe Troubleshooting Guide currently suggests the following:\n```\n# Keep the no-args constructor of the deserialized class\n-keepclassmembers class com.example.MyClass {\n  <init>();\n}\n```\n\nThis means only the no-args constructor is kept, but not any other constructors. However, especially for Kotlin I assume it is common that classes don\'t have a no-args constructor because you might declare properties and the primary constructor at once, e.g. `class MyClass(val s: String)` (see [Kotlin documentation](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/classes.html#constructors)). Not sure though if using that is a good idea in combination with Gson because it then requires JDK Unsafe to create instances, but that is a different topic.\n\nSo there are two questions:\n- Should the Troubleshooting Guide rather recommend `<init>(...);` (all constructors), so that the users don\'t experience issues with R8 anymore (but implicitly depend on JDK Unsafe; using `GsonBuilder.disableJdkUnsafe()` would cause Gson to fail with a different exception)\n- Should the Troubleshooting Guide recommend `-keep` instead of `-keepclassmembers`. In case the `<init>` rule for the class properly matches a constructor it might not matter. But in case `<init>();` is used, but a no-args constructor does not exist, then `-keep` seems to at least have the side-effect that R8 does not make the class abstract (and then using JDK Unsafe an instance can be created).\n\n### Troubleshooting Guide: Recommend `@Keep` for Android\nInstead of configuring ProGuard / R8 rules, it might be easier for Android developers to use `@Keep` on the corresponding class or constructor, see https://developer.android.com/studio/write/annotations#keep\n\n### Preventing R8 from making classes abstract / removing no-args constructor\n\nIt would be good if we could adjust the default rules to avoid the "Abstract classes can\'t be instantiated!" exception (for most cases) in the first place.\n\nThere is probably no general way to detect if a class might be used with Gson, but the most reliable variant might be to keep the constructor if any of the Gson annotations is used by a class.\n\nThis can probably be achieved with an [`-if` rule](https://www.guardsquare.com/manual/configuration/usage#if) (see also [answers to this Stack Overflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/q/63162818)). For example:\n```\n# If class has fields with `@SerializedName` annotation keep its constructors\n-if class * {\n  @com.google.gson.annotations.SerializedName <fields>;\n}\n-keep class <1> {\n  <init>(...);\n}\n```\n(duplicated for all Gson annotations)\n\nBut it looks like this is not enough, maybe because there is no `-keep` (or `-keepclasseswithmembers`) rule for the class in the first place so `-if` somehow has no effect? You additionally need the following (duplicated for all Gson annotations probably):\n```\n-keepclasseswithmembers class * {\n  @com.google.gson.annotations.SerializedName <fields>;\n}\n```\nOnly then the class is not made abstract and the constructor is properly kept...\n\n(As side note: Having only the `-keepclasseswithmembers ... { @SerializedName }` above, but not the `-if ... -keep` seems to prevent R8 from making the class abstract, but still removes all constructors, so users would be dependent on JDK Unsafe then.)\n\nOr similar to https://github.com/google/gson/issues/2379#issuecomment-1564517629 maybe the following would work as well:\n```\n-keepclasseswithmembers class * {\n  <init>(...);\n  @com.google.gson.annotations.SerializedName <fields>;\n}\n```\nThere is however probably no need for the `-if` rule shown in the original comment, unless that has some special effect, see https://github.com/google/gson/pull/2397#issuecomment-1575236086.\n\n### R8 makes class abstract but still keeps constructors\n\nIt also looks like the Android app build creates (for some reason) additional constructors / keeps constructors even when the class is made abstract. Due to this, the Troubleshooting Guide URLs are unfortunately not included in the exception messages (they are only added at the moment when there are no constructors).\nNot really sure why these constructors exist in the first place and are kept even when the class is made abstract. In the R8 integration test of Gson this behavior was not seen.\n\nMaybe we should remove the `getDeclaredConstructors().length == 0` check if the class is abstract and always refer to the Troubleshooting Guide. The guide would have to be adjusted then though to also properly cover the case where the class was indeed abstract in the source code.\n\n---\n\nAny additional feedback is highly appreciated!\n\n\nIssue comments:\n\n\nFeature Context:\nFile: Troubleshooting.md\nLine number range: 1 - 329\nContent:\n1. # Troubleshooting Guide\n2. \n3. This guide describes how to troubleshoot common issues when using Gson.\n4. \n5. <!-- The \'<a id="..."></a>\' anchors below are used to create stable links; don\'t remove or rename them -->\n6. <!-- Use only lowercase IDs, GitHub seems to not support uppercase IDs, see also https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/50962 -->\n7. \n8. ## <a id="class-cast-exception"></a> `ClassCastException` when using deserialized object\n9. \n10. **Symptom:** `ClassCastException` is thrown when accessing an object deserialized by Gson\n11. \n12. **Reason:** Your code is most likely not type-safe\n13. \n14. **Solution:** Make sure your code adheres to the following:\n15. \n16. - Avoid raw types: Instead of calling `fromJson(..., List.class)`, create for example a `TypeToken<List<MyClass>>`.\n17.   See the [user guide](UserGuide.md#collections-examples) for more information.\n18. - When using `TypeToken` prefer the `Gson.fromJson` overloads with `TypeToken` parameter such as [`fromJson(Reader, TypeToken)`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/Gson.html#fromJson(java.io.Reader,com.google.gson.reflect.TypeToken)).\n19.   The overloads with `Type` parameter do not provide any type-safety guarantees.\n20. - When using `TypeToken` make sure you don\'t capture a type variable. For example avoid something like `new TypeToken<List<T>>()` (where `T` is a type variable). Due to Java type erasure the actual type of `T` is not available at runtime. Refactor your code to pass around `TypeToken` instances or use [`TypeToken.getParameterized(...)`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/reflect/TypeToken.html#getParameterized(java.lang.reflect.Type,java.lang.reflect.Type...)), for example `TypeToken.getParameterized(List.class, elementClass)`.\n21. \n22. ## <a id="reflection-inaccessible"></a> `InaccessibleObjectException`: \'module ... does not "opens ..." to unnamed module\'\n23. \n24. **Symptom:** An exception with a message in the form \'module ... does not "opens ..." to unnamed module\' is thrown\n25. \n26. **Reason:** You use Gson by accident to access internal fields of third-party classes\n27. \n28. **Solution:** Write custom Gson [`TypeAdapter`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html) implementations for the affected classes or change the type of your data. If this occurs for a field in one of your classes which you did not actually want to serialize or deserialize in the first place, you can exclude that field, see the [user guide](UserGuide.md#excluding-fields-from-serialization-and-deserialization).\n29. \n30. **Explanation:**\n31. \n32. When no built-in adapter for a type exists and no custom adapter has been registered, Gson falls back to using reflection to access the fields of a class (including `private` ones). Most likely you are seeing this error because you (by accident) rely on the reflection-based adapter for third-party classes. That should be avoided because you make yourself dependent on the implementation details of these classes which could change at any point. For the JDK it is also not possible anymore to access internal fields using reflection starting with JDK 17, see [JEP 403](https://openjdk.org/jeps/403).\n33. \n34. If you want to prevent using reflection on third-party classes in the future you can write your own [`ReflectionAccessFilter`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/ReflectionAccessFilter.html) or use one of the predefined ones, such as `ReflectionAccessFilter.BLOCK_ALL_PLATFORM`.\n35. \n36. ## <a id="reflection-inaccessible-to-module-gson"></a> `InaccessibleObjectException`: \'module ... does not "opens ..." to module com.google.gson\'\n37. \n38. **Symptom:** An exception with a message in the form \'module ... does not "opens ..." to module com.google.gson\' is thrown\n39. \n40. **Reason:**\n41. \n42. - If the reported package is your own package then you have not configured the module declaration of your project to allow Gson to use reflection on your classes.\n43. - If the reported package is from a third party library or the JDK see [this troubleshooting point](#inaccessibleobjectexception-module--does-not-opens--to-unnamed-module).\n44. \n45. **Solution:** Make sure the `module-info.java` file of your project allows Gson to use reflection on your classes, for example:\n46. \n47. ```java\n48. module mymodule {\n49.     requires com.google.gson;\n50. \n51.     opens mypackage to com.google.gson;\n52. }\n53. ```\n54. \n55. Or in case this occurs for a field in one of your classes which you did not actually want to serialize or deserialize in the first place, you can exclude that field, see the [user guide](UserGuide.md#excluding-fields-from-serialization-and-deserialization).\n56. \n57. ## <a id="android-app-random-names"></a> Android app not working in Release mode; random property names\n58. \n59. **Symptom:** Your Android app is working fine in Debug mode but fails in Release mode and the JSON properties have seemingly random names such as `a`, `b`, ...\n60. \n61. **Reason:** You probably have not configured ProGuard / R8 correctly\n62. \n63. **Solution:** Make sure you have configured ProGuard / R8 correctly to preserve the names of your fields. See the [Android example](examples/android-proguard-example/README.md) for more information.\n64. \n65. ## <a id="android-app-broken-after-app-update"></a> Android app unable to parse JSON after app update\n66. \n67. **Symptom:** You released a new version of your Android app and it fails to parse JSON data created by the previous version of your app\n68. \n69. **Reason:** You probably have not configured ProGuard / R8 correctly; probably the fields names are being obfuscated and their naming changed between the versions of your app\n70. \n71. **Solution:** Make sure you have configured ProGuard / R8 correctly to preserve the names of your fields. See the [Android example](examples/android-proguard-example/README.md) for more information.\n72. \n73. If you want to preserve backward compatibility for you app you can use [`@SerializedName`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/annotations/SerializedName.html) on the fields to specify the obfuscated name as alternate, for example: `@SerializedName(value = "myprop", alternate = "a")`\n74. \n75. Normally ProGuard and R8 produce a mapping file, this makes it easier to find out the obfuscated field names instead of having to find them out through trial and error or other means. See the [Android Studio user guide](https://developer.android.com/studio/build/shrink-code.html#retracing) for more information.\n76. \n77. ## <a id="default-field-values-missing"></a> Default field values not present after deserialization\n78. \n79. **Symptom:** You have assign default values to fields but after deserialization the fields have their standard value (such as `null` or `0`)\n80. \n81. **Reason:** Gson cannot invoke the constructor of your class and falls back to JDK `Unsafe` (or similar means)\n82. \n83. **Solution:** Make sure that the class:\n84. \n85. - is `static` (explicitly or implicitly when it is a top-level class)\n86. - has a no-args constructor\n87. \n88. Otherwise Gson will by default try to use JDK `Unsafe` or similar means to create an instance of your class without invoking the constructor and without running any initializers. You can also disable that behavior through [`GsonBuilder.disableJdkUnsafe()`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.html#disableJdkUnsafe()) to notice such issues early on.\n89. \n90. ## <a id="anonymous-local-null"></a> `null` values for anonymous and local classes\n91. \n92. **Symptom:** Objects of a class are always serialized as JSON `null` / always deserialized as Java `null`\n93. \n94. **Reason:** The class you are serializing or deserializing is an anonymous or a local class (or you have specified a custom `ExclusionStrategy`)\n95. \n96. **Solution:** Convert the class to a `static` nested class. If the class is already `static` make sure you have not specified a Gson `ExclusionStrategy` which might exclude the class.\n97. \n98. Notes:\n99. \n100. - "double brace-initialization" also creates anonymous classes\n101. - Local record classes (feature added in Java 16) are supported by Gson and are not affected by this\n102. \n103. ## <a id="map-key-wrong-json"></a> Map keys having unexpected format in JSON\n104. \n105. **Symptom:** JSON output for `Map` keys is unexpected / cannot be deserialized again\n106. \n107. **Reason:** The `Map` key type is \'complex\' and you have not configured the `GsonBuilder` properly\n108. \n109. **Solution:** Use [`GsonBuilder.enableComplexMapKeySerialization()`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.html#enableComplexMapKeySerialization()). See also the [user guide](UserGuide.md#maps-examples) for more information.\n110. \n111. ## <a id="malformed-json"></a> Parsing JSON fails with `MalformedJsonException`\n112. \n113. **Symptom:** JSON parsing fails with `MalformedJsonException`\n114. \n115. **Reason:** The JSON data is actually malformed\n116. \n117. **Solution:** During debugging, log the JSON data right before calling Gson methods or set a breakpoint to inspect the data and make sure it has the expected format. Sometimes APIs might return HTML error pages (instead of JSON data) when reaching rate limits or when other errors occur. Also read the location information of the `MalformedJsonException` exception message, it indicates where exactly in the document the malformed data was detected, including the [JSONPath](https://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/).\n118. \n119. For example, let\'s assume you want to deserialize the following JSON data:\n120. \n121. ```json\n122. {\n123.   "languages": [\n124.     "English",\n125.     "French",\n126.   ]\n127. }\n128. ```\n129. \n130. This will fail with an exception similar to this one: `MalformedJsonException: Use JsonReader.setLenient(true) to accept malformed JSON at line 5 column 4 path $.languages[2]`  \n131. The problem here is the trailing comma (`,`) after `"French"`, trailing commas are not allowed by the JSON specification. The location information "line 5 column 4" points to the `]` in the JSON data (with some slight inaccuracies) because Gson expected another value after `,` instead of the closing `]`. The JSONPath `$.languages[2]` in the exception message also points there: `$.` refers to the root object, `languages` refers to its member of that name and `[2]` refers to the (missing) third value in the JSON array value of that member (numbering starts at 0, so it is `[2]` instead of `[3]`).  \n132. The proper solution here is to fix the malformed JSON data.\n133. \n134. To spot syntax errors in the JSON data easily you can open it in an editor with support for JSON, for example Visual Studio Code. It will highlight within the JSON data the error location and show why the JSON data is considered invalid.\n135. \n136. ## <a id="number-parsed-as-double"></a> Integral JSON number is parsed as `double`\n137. \n138. **Symptom:** JSON data contains an integral number such as `45` but Gson returns it as `double`\n139. \n140. **Reason:** When parsing a JSON number as `Object`, Gson will by default create always return a `double`\n141. \n142. **Solution:** Use [`GsonBuilder.setObjectToNumberStrategy`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.html#setObjectToNumberStrategy(com.google.gson.ToNumberStrategy)) to specify what type of number should be returned\n143. \n144. ## <a id="default-lenient"></a> Malformed JSON not rejected\n145. \n146. **Symptom:** Gson parses malformed JSON without throwing any exceptions\n147. \n148. **Reason:** Due to legacy reasons Gson performs parsing by default in lenient mode\n149. \n150. **Solution:** See [`Gson` class documentation](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/Gson.html#default-lenient) section "Lenient JSON handling"\n151. \n152. Note: Even in non-lenient mode Gson deviates slightly from the JSON specification, see [`JsonReader.setLenient`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/stream/JsonReader.html#setLenient(boolean)) for more details.\n153. \n154. ## <a id="unexpected-json-structure"></a> `IllegalStateException`: "Expected ... but was ..."\n155. \n156. **Symptom:** An `IllegalStateException` with a message in the form "Expected ... but was ..." is thrown\n157. \n158. **Reason:** The JSON data does not have the correct format\n159. \n160. **Solution:** Make sure that your classes correctly model the JSON data. Also during debugging log the JSON data right before calling Gson methods or set a breakpoint to inspect the data and make sure it has the expected format. Read the location information of the exception message, it indicates where exactly in the document the error occurred, including the [JSONPath](https://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/).\n161. \n162. For example, let\'s assume you have the following Java class:\n163. \n164. ```java\n165. class WebPage {\n166.     String languages;\n167. }\n168. ```\n169. \n170. And you want to deserialize the following JSON data:\n171. \n172. ```json\n173. {\n174.   "languages": ["English", "French"]\n175. }\n176. ```\n177. \n178. This will fail with an exception similar to this one: `IllegalStateException: Expected a string but was BEGIN_ARRAY at line 2 column 17 path $.languages`  \n179. This means Gson expected a JSON string value but found the beginning of a JSON array (`[`). The location information "line 2 column 17" points to the `[` in the JSON data (with some slight inaccuracies), so does the JSONPath `$.languages` in the exception message. It refers to the `languages` member of the root object (`$.`).  \n180. The solution here is to change in the `WebPage` class the field `String languages` to `List<String> languages`.\n181. \n182. ## <a id="adapter-not-null-safe"></a> `IllegalStateException`: "Expected ... but was NULL"\n183. \n184. **Symptom:** An `IllegalStateException` with a message in the form "Expected ... but was NULL" is thrown\n185. \n186. **Reason:**\n187. \n188. - A built-in adapter does not support JSON null values\n189. - You have written a custom `TypeAdapter` which does not properly handle JSON null values\n190. \n191. **Solution:** If this occurs for a custom adapter you wrote, add code similar to the following at the beginning of its `read` method:\n192. \n193. ```java\n194. @Override\n195. public MyClass read(JsonReader in) throws IOException {\n196.     if (in.peek() == JsonToken.NULL) {\n197.         in.nextNull();\n198.         return null;\n199.     }\n200. \n201.     ...\n202. }\n203. ```\n204. \n205. Alternatively you can call [`nullSafe()`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html#nullSafe()) on the adapter instance you created.\n206. \n207. ## <a id="serialize-nulls"></a> Properties missing in JSON\n208. \n209. **Symptom:** Properties are missing in the JSON output\n210. \n211. **Reason:** Gson by default omits JSON null from the output (or: ProGuard / R8 is not configured correctly and removed unused fields)\n212. \n213. **Solution:** Use [`GsonBuilder.serializeNulls()`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.html#serializeNulls())\n214. \n215. Note: Gson does not support anonymous and local classes and will serialize them as JSON null, see the [related troubleshooting point](#null-values-for-anonymous-and-local-classes).\n216. \n217. ## <a id="android-internal-fields"></a> JSON output changes for newer Android versions\n218. \n219. **Symptom:** The JSON output differs when running on newer Android versions\n220. \n221. **Reason:** You use Gson by accident to access internal fields of Android classes\n222. \n223. **Solution:** Write custom Gson [`TypeAdapter`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html) implementations for the affected classes or change the type of your data\n224. \n225. **Explanation:**\n226. \n227. When no built-in adapter for a type exists and no custom adapter has been registered, Gson falls back to using reflection to access the fields of a class (including `private` ones). Most likely you are experiencing this issue because you (by accident) rely on the reflection-based adapter for Android classes. That should be avoided because you make yourself dependent on the implementation details of these classes which could change at any point.\n228. \n229. If you want to prevent using reflection on third-party classes in the future you can write your own [`ReflectionAccessFilter`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/ReflectionAccessFilter.html) or use one of the predefined ones, such as `ReflectionAccessFilter.BLOCK_ALL_PLATFORM`.\n230. \n231. ## <a id="json-static-fields"></a> JSON output contains values of `static` fields\n232. \n233. **Symptom:** The JSON output contains values of `static` fields\n234. \n235. **Reason:** You used `GsonBuilder.excludeFieldsWithModifiers` to overwrite the default excluded modifiers\n236. \n237. **Solution:** When calling `GsonBuilder.excludeFieldsWithModifiers` you overwrite the default excluded modifiers. Therefore, you have to explicitly exclude `static` fields if desired. This can be done by adding `Modifier.STATIC` as additional argument.\n238. \n239. ## <a id="no-such-method-error"></a> `NoSuchMethodError` when calling Gson methods\n240. \n241. **Symptom:** A `java.lang.NoSuchMethodError` is thrown when trying to call certain Gson methods\n242. \n243. **Reason:**\n244. \n245. - You have multiple versions of Gson on your classpath\n246. - Or, the Gson version you compiled against is different from the one on your classpath\n247. - Or, you are using a code shrinking tool such as ProGuard or R8 which removed methods from Gson\n248. \n249. **Solution:** First disable any code shrinking tools such as ProGuard or R8 and check if the issue persists. If not, you have to tweak the configuration of that tool to not modify Gson classes. Otherwise verify that the Gson JAR on your classpath is the same you are compiling against, and that there is only one Gson JAR on your classpath. See [this Stack Overflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/q/227486) to find out where a class is loaded from. For example, for debugging you could include the following code:\n250. \n251. ```java\n252. System.out.println(Gson.class.getProtectionDomain().getCodeSource().getLocation());\n253. ```\n254. \n255. If that fails with a `NullPointerException` you have to try one of the other ways to find out where a class is loaded from.\n256. \n257. ## <a id="duplicate-fields"></a> `IllegalArgumentException`: \'Class ... declares multiple JSON fields named \'...\'\'\n258. \n259. **Symptom:** An exception with the message \'Class ... declares multiple JSON fields named \'...\'\' is thrown\n260. \n261. **Reason:**\n262. \n263. - The name you have specified with a [`@SerializedName`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/annotations/SerializedName.html) annotation for a field collides with the name of another field\n264. - The [`FieldNamingStrategy`](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/FieldNamingStrategy.html) you have specified produces conflicting field names\n265. - A field of your class has the same name as the field of a superclass\n266. \n267. Gson prevents multiple fields with the same name because during deserialization it would be ambiguous for which field the JSON data should be deserialized. For serialization it would cause the same field to appear multiple times in JSON. While the JSON specification permits this, it is likely that the application parsing the JSON data will not handle it correctly.\n268. \n269. **Solution:** First identify the fields with conflicting names based on the exception message. Then decide if you want to rename one of them using the [`@SerializedName`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/annotations/SerializedName.html) annotation, or if you want to [exclude](UserGuide.md#excluding-fields-from-serialization-and-deserialization) one of them. When excluding one of the fields you have to include it for both serialization and deserialization (even if your application only performs one of these actions) because the duplicate field check cannot differentiate between these actions.\n270. \n271. ## <a id="java-lang-class-unsupported"></a> `UnsupportedOperationException` when serializing or deserializing `java.lang.Class`\n272. \n273. **Symptom:** An `UnsupportedOperationException` is thrown when trying to serialize or deserialize `java.lang.Class`\n274. \n275. **Reason:** Gson intentionally does not permit serializing and deserializing `java.lang.Class` for security reasons. Otherwise a malicious user could make your application load an arbitrary class from the classpath and, depending on what your application does with the `Class`, in the worst case perform a remote code execution attack.\n276. \n277. **Solution:** First check if you really need to serialize or deserialize a `Class`. Often it is possible to use string aliases and then map them to the known `Class`; you could write a custom [`TypeAdapter`](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html) to do this. If the `Class` values are not known in advance, try to introduce a common base class or interface for all these classes and then verify that the deserialized class is a subclass. For example assuming the base class is called `MyBaseClass`, your custom `TypeAdapter` should load the class like this:\n278. \n279. ```java\n280. Class.forName(jsonString, false, getClass().getClassLoader()).asSubclass(MyBaseClass.class)\n281. ```\n282. \n283. This will not initialize arbitrary classes, and it will throw a `ClassCastException` if the loaded class is not the same as or a subclass of `MyBaseClass`.\n284. \n285. ## <a id="type-token-raw"></a> `IllegalStateException`: \'TypeToken must be created with a type argument\' <br> `RuntimeException`: \'Missing type parameter\'\n286. \n287. **Symptom:** An `IllegalStateException` with the message \'TypeToken must be created with a type argument\' is thrown.  \n288. For older Gson versions a `RuntimeException` with message \'Missing type parameter\' is thrown.\n289. \n290. **Reason:**\n291. \n292. - You created a `TypeToken` without type argument, for example `new TypeToken() {}` (note the missing `<...>`). You always have to provide the type argument, for example like this: `new TypeToken<List<String>>() {}`. Normally the compiler will also emit a \'raw types\' warning when you forget the `<...>`.\n293. - You are using a code shrinking tool such as ProGuard or R8 (Android app builds normally have this enabled by default) but have not configured it correctly for usage with Gson.\n294. \n295. **Solution:** When you are using a code shrinking tool such as ProGuard or R8 you have to adjust your configuration to include the following rules:\n296. \n297. ```\n298. # Keep generic signatures; needed for correct type resolution\n299. -keepattributes Signature\n300. \n301. # Keep class TypeToken (respectively its generic signature)\n302. -keep class com.google.gson.reflect.TypeToken { *; }\n303. \n304. # Keep any (anonymous) classes extending TypeToken\n305. -keep class * extends com.google.gson.reflect.TypeToken\n306. ```\n307. \n308. See also the [Android example](examples/android-proguard-example/README.md) for more information.\n309. \n310. Note: For newer Gson versions these rules might be applied automatically; make sure you are using the latest Gson version and the latest version of the code shrinking tool.\n311. \n312. ## <a id="r8-abstract-class"></a> `JsonIOException`: \'Abstract classes can\'t be instantiated!\' (R8)\n313. \n314. **Symptom:** A `JsonIOException` with the message \'Abstract classes can\'t be instantiated!\' is thrown; the class mentioned in the exception message is not actually `abstract` in your source code, and you are using the code shrinking tool R8 (Android app builds normally have this configured by default).\n315. \n316. **Reason:** The code shrinking tool R8 performs optimizations where it removes the no-args constructor from a class and makes the class `abstract`. Due to this Gson cannot create an instance of the class.\n317. \n318. **Solution:** Make sure the class has a no-args constructor, then adjust your R8 configuration file to keep the constructor of the class. For example:\n319. \n320. ```\n321. # Keep the no-args constructor of the deserialized class\n322. -keepclassmembers class com.example.MyClass {\n323.   <init>();\n324. }\n325. ```\n326. \n327. For Android you can add this rule to the `proguard-rules.pro` file, see also the [Android documentation](https://developer.android.com/build/shrink-code#keep-code). In case the class name in the exception message is obfuscated, see the Android documentation about [retracing](https://developer.android.com/build/shrink-code#retracing).\n328. \n329. Note: If the class which you are trying to deserialize is actually abstract, then this exception is probably unrelated to R8 and you will have to implement a custom [`InstanceCreator`](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/InstanceCreator.html) or [`TypeAdapter`](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html) which creates an instance of a non-abstract subclass of the class.\n\n\nFile: examples/android-proguard-example/README.md\nLine number range: 1 - 17\nContent:\n1. # android-proguard-example\n2. \n3. Example Android project showing how to properly configure [ProGuard](https://www.guardsquare.com/proguard).\n4. ProGuard is a tool for \'shrinking\' and obfuscating compiled classes. It can rename methods and fields,\n5. or remove them if they appear to be unused. This can cause issues for Gson which uses Java reflection to\n6. access the fields of a class. It is necessary to configure ProGuard to make sure that Gson works correctly.\n7. \n8. Also have a look at the [ProGuard manual](https://www.guardsquare.com/manual/configuration/usage#keepoverview)\n9. and the [ProGuard Gson examples](https://www.guardsquare.com/manual/configuration/examples#gson) for more\n10. details on how ProGuard can be configured.\n11. \n12. The R8 code shrinker uses the same rule format as ProGuard, but there are differences between these two\n13. tools. Have a look at R8\'s Compatibility FAQ, and especially at the [Gson section](https://r8.googlesource.com/r8/+/refs/heads/main/compatibility-faq.md#gson).\n14. \n15. Note that newer Gson versions apply some of the rules shown in `proguard.cfg` automatically by default,\n16. see the file [`gson/META-INF/proguard/gson.pro`](/gson/src/main/resources/META-INF/proguard/gson.pro) for\n17. the Gson version you are using.\n\n\nFile: gson/src/main/java/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.java\nLine number range: 103 - 106\nContent:\n103.   private boolean generateNonExecutableJson = DEFAULT_JSON_NON_EXECUTABLE;\n104.   private boolean lenient = DEFAULT_LENIENT;\n105.   private boolean useJdkUnsafe = DEFAULT_USE_JDK_UNSAFE;\n106.   private ToNumberStrategy objectToNumberStrategy = DEFAULT_OBJECT_TO_NUMBER_STRATEGY;\n\n\nFile: gson/src/main/java/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.java\nLine number range: 756 - 760\nContent:\n756.   @CanIgnoreReturnValue\n757.   public GsonBuilder disableJdkUnsafe() {\n758.     this.useJdkUnsafe = false;\n759.     return this;\n760.   }\n\n\nFile: gson/src/main/java/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.java\nLine number range: 806 - 813\nContent:\n806.     return new Gson(excluder, fieldNamingPolicy, new HashMap<>(instanceCreators),\n807.         serializeNulls, complexMapKeySerialization,\n808.         generateNonExecutableJson, escapeHtmlChars, formattingStyle, lenient,\n809.         serializeSpecialFloatingPointValues, useJdkUnsafe, longSerializationPolicy,\n810.         datePattern, dateStyle, timeStyle, new ArrayList<>(this.factories),\n811.         new ArrayList<>(this.hierarchyFactories), factories,\n812.         objectToNumberStrategy, numberToNumberStrategy, new ArrayList<>(reflectionFilters));\n813.   }\n\n\nFile: gson/src/main/java/com/google/gson/JsonIOException.java\nLine number range: 16 - 45\nContent:\n16. package com.google.gson;\n17. \n18. /**\n19.  * This exception is raised when Gson was unable to read an input stream\n20.  * or write to one.\n21.  * \n22.  * @author Inderjeet Singh\n23.  * @author Joel Leitch\n24.  */\n25. public final class JsonIOException extends JsonParseException {\n26.   private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;\n27. \n28.   public JsonIOException(String msg) {\n29.     super(msg);\n30.   }\n31. \n32.   public JsonIOException(String msg, Throwable cause) {\n33.     super(msg, cause);\n34.   }\n35. \n36.   /**\n37.    * Creates exception with the specified cause.

Title: GitHub Improve default ProGuard / R8 rules and Troubleshooting Guide · Issue #2401 · google/gson
URL: https://github.com/google/gson/issues/2401
Content: (duplicated for all Gson annotations)

But it looks like this is not enough, maybe because there is no `-keep` (or `-keepclasseswithmembers`) rule for the class in the first place so `-if` somehow has no effect? You additionally need the following (duplicated for all Gson annotations probably):

```
-keepclasseswithmembers class  { @com.google.gson.annotations.SerializedName ; } 
```

Only then the class is not made abstract and the constructor is properly kept... [...] (As side note: Having only the `-keepclasseswithmembers ... { @SerializedName }` above, but not the `-if ... -keep` seems to prevent R8 from making the class abstract, but still removes all constructors, so users would be dependent on JDK Unsafe then.)

Or similar to #2379 (comment) maybe the following would work as well:

```
-keepclasseswithmembers class  { (...); @com.google.gson.annotations.SerializedName ; } 
``` [...] Should the Troubleshooting Guide recommend `-keep` instead of `-keepclassmembers`. In case the  rule for the class properly matches a constructor it might not matter. But in case `();` is used, but a no-args constructor does not exist, then `-keep` seems to at least have the side-effect that R8 does not make the class abstract (and then using JDK Unsafe an instance can be created).

Title: GitHub gson/Troubleshooting.md at main · google/gson
URL: https://github.com/google/gson/blob/main/Troubleshooting.md
Content: Reason: The code shrinking tool R8 performs optimizations where it removes the no-args constructor from a class and makes the class `abstract`. Due to this Gson cannot create an instance of the class.

Solution: Make sure the class has a no-args constructor, then adjust your R8 configuration file to keep the constructor of the class. For example:

```
# Keep the no-args constructor of the deserialized class
-keepclassmembers class com.example.MyClass {
  <init>();
}

``` [...] See the ProGuard / R8 section for more information.

Note: For newer Gson versions these rules might be applied automatically; make sure you are using the latest Gson version and the latest version of the code shrinking tool.

## `JsonIOException`: 'Abstract classes can't be instantiated!' (R8) [...] Note: If the class which you are trying to deserialize is actually abstract, then this exception is probably unrelated to R8 and you will have to implement a custom `InstanceCreator` or `TypeAdapter` which creates an instance of a non-abstract subclass of the class. If you already wrote a custom adapter, but it is not used, see this troubleshooting point.

@jemshit kindly add the following lines for Gson to prevent proguard from obfuscating field's serialize name mark with @SerializedName annotation.

```
# Prevent R8 from leaving Data object members always null -keepclassmembers,allowobfuscation class  { @com.google.gson.annotations.SerializedName ; } 
```

| # Also allow obfuscation, assuming that users will additionally use @SerializedName or |

Content: The consequences of these rules can also leak into object hierarchies. For example, if for any reason a base class fails to have a default constructor that's callable from a deriving class—that is, a `public` or `protected` constructor that takes no parameters—then a class that derives from it can't automatically generate its own default constructor. [...] If any constructor is explicitly declared, then no default constructor is automatically generated.
 If a virtual destructor is explicitly declared, then no default destructor is automatically generated.
 If a move constructor or move-assignment operator is explicitly declared, then: [...] Generation of the default constructor is still prevented by declaring the copy constructor, but you can bring it back by explicitly defaulting it.
 Explicitly defaulted special member functions are still considered trivial, so there's no performance penalty, and `noncopyable` isn't prevented from being a true POD type.
 The copy constructor and copy-assignment operator are public but deleted. It's a compile-time error to define or call a deleted function.

Focus on classes with Gson annotations to scope impact.\n  - Documentation needs stable anchors (existing pattern with lowercase IDs).\n  - Maintain backward compatibility with existing public APIs and behaviors; only error message text changes may affect tests relying on exact strings.\n\n3) Implementation Plan\n\nA) Improve default ProGuard/R8 rules\n\n- File to modify: gson/src/main/resources/META-INF/proguard/gson.pro\n\n- Changes to implement:\n  - Add rules that detect classes likely used by Gson (via annotations) and:\n    - Prevent R8 from making them abstract.\n    - Keep their constructors, preferably all constructors (<init>(...);) to avoid mismatches where no-args don’t exist (Kotlin primary constructor scenario).\n  - Use a conservative two-pronged approach since real-world reports indicate -if alone was not sufficient:\n    - For each relevant annotation, add:\n      - An -if rule that matches classes with a Gson annotation and a corresponding -keep rule to keep all constructors:\n        - Examples (no code to paste): for @SerializedName, @Expose, @Since, @Until on fields; for @JsonAdapter on classes or fields.\n      - A keepclasseswithmembers rule matching classes with those annotations to ensure they are not made abstract even if the constructor pattern match is tricky. Consider allowobfuscation variants to avoid unintended name retention.\n  - Scope:\n    - Fields: @com.google.gson.annotations.SerializedName, @com.google.gson.annotations.Expose, @com.google.gson.annotations.Since, @com.google.gson.annotations.Until\n    - Types: @com.google.gson.annotations.JsonAdapter (on class)\n    - Note: @SerializedName also targets methods, but Gson currently errors when only methods are annotated without field annotations. Favor field-based matching in default rules.\n  - Explicitly keep constructors via <init>(...); rather than only <init>(); to cover Kotlin classes without a no-args constructor. This reduces surprises where R8 removes constructors and Gson falls back to Unsafe or fails when Unsafe is disabled.\n  - Keep obfuscation allowed unless field names must be preserved manually. The default rules should not globally prevent obfuscation; instruct users to preserve field names as needed (documented in the Android example and Troubleshooting.md).\n\n- Why this works:\n  - The combination of -if + -keep ensures constructors are preserved for classes using Gson annotations.\n  - The additional -keepclasseswithmembers for the same annotation patterns helps prevent the class from being made abstract and supports scenarios observed where constructors persisted but abstract transformation still occurred.\n  - Limiting to classes with Gson annotations focuses the impact to likely Gson-mapped classes without bloating the app.\n\nB) Update the Troubleshooting Guide\n\n- File to modify: Troubleshooting.md\n\n- Sections to update:\n  - r8-abstract-class (anchor id: r8-abstract-class).\n  - Android and ProGuard/R8 related sections (cross-link to the Android example and gson.pro).\n\n- Content changes:\n  - Replace/augment the current recommendation that only keeps a no-args constructor with:\n    - Recommendation to keep all constructors (<init>(...);) to handle Kotlin classes and avoid R8 edge cases where no no-args exists.\n    - Highlight the difference between -keep vs -keepclassmembers:\n      - -keep can help prevent R8 from making the class abstract even when a constructor signature doesn’t match.\n      - If you know the exact classes, -keep class com.example.MyClass { <init>(...); } is often safer.\n    - Present a robust pattern using -if and a paired -keepclasseswithmembers for classes using Gson annotations (e.g., @SerializedName). Make clear that for most cases, configuring rules for annotations is the most reliable general solution.\n    - Clarify Kotlin implications:\n      - Many Kotlin classes lack a no-args constructor. Gson may use JDK Unsafe by default to construct them.\n      - If GsonBuilder.disableJdkUnsafe() is enabled, users must supply a no-args constructor or a custom InstanceCreator/TypeAdapter.\n    - Recommend Android’s @Keep annotation as a simpler option:\n      - Suggest applying @Keep on the class or constructor in Android projects to avoid the need for ProGuard/R8 configuration per class (link: https://developer.android.com/studio/write/annotations#keep).\n    - Mention that R8 might still keep constructors even when making classes abstract; advise that the presence of the “abstract” error message with a Troubleshooting link is normal and to follow the steps provided.\n    - Reiterate the guidance for truly abstract classes: if the class is actually abstract in source, users need an InstanceCreator or TypeAdapter for a concrete subtype.\n\n- Rationale:\n  - Provides clear, actionable steps for common scenarios, including Kotlin and Android specifics.\n  - Reduces confusion caused by having only the no-args constructor sample.\n  - Improves success rate in real-world R8 builds by documenting robust rule combinations.\n\nC) Update Android example readme\n\n- File to modify: examples/android-proguard-example/README.md\n\n- Changes to implement:\n  - Add a note that newer Gson versions apply additional default rules (via META-INF/proguard/gson.pro) to keep constructors for classes using Gson annotations, reducing the likelihood of “abstract” issues.\n  - Show or refer to the annotation-based pattern and mention @Keep as an alternative.\n  - Clarify that obfuscation and shrinking still occur; field name preservation may still require specific rules or use of @SerializedName with stable names.\n\nD) Improve exception messaging to always reference the Troubleshooting Guide (optional but recommended)\n\n- File to modify: gson/src/main/java/com/google/gson/internal/ConstructorConstructor.java\n\n- Functions/blocks to change:\n  - Method: checkInstantiable(Class<?> c)\n    - Current behavior: Adds Troubleshooting link only if the class is abstract and getDeclaredConstructors().length == 0; otherwise returns an abstract-class message without a link.\n    - Change: Whenever Modifier.isAbstract(modifiers) is true, ensure the returned message includes a reference to the Troubleshooting Guide URL (TroubleshootingGuide.createUrl("r8-abstract-class")), regardless of constructor count.\n    - Keep separate clarity for real abstract classes vs R8-affected ones in the message text as appropriate, but always include the URL.\n\n- Integration:\n  - This only affects messages surfaced via JsonIOException thrown by ObjectConstructor implementations and UnsafeAllocator. No behavior change for construction; only message content is updated.\n\n4) Considerations\n\n- Potential impacts:\n  - Default rules addition:\n    - Slight increase in kept constructors for classes using Gson annotations; should be minimal and acceptable.\n    - We deliberately avoid global keep rules; only classes with Gson annotations are targeted to minimize the footprint.\n  - Error message text change:\n    - If there are tests or user code matching exact error strings, those may need to be updated to the new wording. Keep the structure similar; only add the troubleshooting link consistently.\n\n- Backward compatibility:\n  - No public API changes.\n  - Default behavior remains unchanged; only shipping rules and doc guidance change. Messages include links more consistently.\n\n- Dependencies and prerequisites:\n  - Ensure the gson.pro syntax is compatible with both ProGuard and R8 (the targeted rules use common constructs: -if, -keep, -keepclasseswithmembers).\n  - Confirm that the META-INF/proguard/gson.pro file is packaged and honored by the build tools (already the case in recent versions).\n  - Keep documentation anchors stable (use existing id r8-abstract-class).\n  - Make sure the Troubleshooting Guide addresses both R8-modified and truly abstract-class scenarios.\n\nSummary of files and changes\n\n- gson/src/main/resources/META-INF/proguard/gson.pro\n  - Add annotation-based -if rules that keep all constructors of classes using Gson annotations.\n  - Add corresponding -keepclasseswithmembers rules for the same annotations to prevent classes from being made abstract.\n  - Limit scope to fields (and classes for @JsonAdapter) to align with Gson behavior; allow obfuscation unless explicitly needed otherwise.\n\n- Troubleshooting.md\n  - Update section with id r8-abstract-class:\n    - Recommend keeping all constructors (<init>(...);).\n    - Discuss -keep vs -keepclassmembers trade-offs.\n    - Provide robust annotation-based rule patterns (-if + -keepclasseswithmembers).\n    - Add Kotlin/Unsafe guidance and Android @Keep recommendation.\n    - Cover both R8-abstract and truly abstract cases.\n\n- examples/android-proguard-example/README.md\n  - Note enhanced default rules in gson.pro.\n  - Include guidance on @Keep and annotation-based patterns.\n  - Clarify implications for field name obfuscation and @SerializedName.\n\n- gson/src/main/java/com/google/gson/internal/ConstructorConstructor.java\n  - In checkInstantiable, ensure the abstract-class case always includes the Troubleshooting Guide URL, regardless of constructor presence.\n\nThis plan aligns the shipped defaults with common Android/R8 realities, gives developers clearer guidance, and reduces the frequency of “abstract class” instantiation failures without broadly disabling shrinking/obfuscation.' additional_kwargs={'refusal': None} response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 5269, 'prompt_tokens': 14976, 'total_tokens': 20245, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'reasoning_tokens': 2624, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': 0, 'cached_tokens': 0}}, 'model_name': 'gpt-5-2025-08-07', 'system_fingerprint': None, 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None} id='run--03a16efd-a00c-439b-9f0d-4910413e8f4c-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 14976, 'output_tokens': 5269, 'total_tokens': 20245, 'input_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'cache_read': 0}, 'output_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'reasoning': 2624}}

content='--- BEGIN ISSUE INFO ---\nIssue title:\nImprove default ProGuard / R8 rules and Troubleshooting Guide\n\nIssue description: \n# Problem solved by the feature\nImprove the default ProGuard / R8 rules in `META-INF/proguard/gson.pro` added by #2397, and the Troubleshooting Guide.\n\n# Feature description\nI was testing the new default rules with an Android app and Kotlin classes, and there might be the following areas to improve.\n\n### Troubleshooting Guide: `JsonIOException`: \'Abstract classes can\'t be instantiated!\' (R8)\n\nThe Troubleshooting Guide currently suggests the following:\n```\n# Keep the no-args constructor of the deserialized class\n-keepclassmembers class com.example.MyClass {\n  <init>();\n}\n```\n\nThis means only the no-args constructor is kept, but not any other constructors. However, especially for Kotlin I assume it is common that classes don\'t have a no-args constructor because you might declare properties and the primary constructor at once, e.g. `class MyClass(val s: String)` (see [Kotlin documentation](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/classes.html#constructors)). Not sure though if using that is a good idea in combination with Gson because it then requires JDK Unsafe to create instances, but that is a different topic.\n\nSo there are two questions:\n- Should the Troubleshooting Guide rather recommend `<init>(...);` (all constructors), so that the users don\'t experience issues with R8 anymore (but implicitly depend on JDK Unsafe; using `GsonBuilder.disableJdkUnsafe()` would cause Gson to fail with a different exception)\n- Should the Troubleshooting Guide recommend `-keep` instead of `-keepclassmembers`. In case the `<init>` rule for the class properly matches a constructor it might not matter. But in case `<init>();` is used, but a no-args constructor does not exist, then `-keep` seems to at least have the side-effect that R8 does not make the class abstract (and then using JDK Unsafe an instance can be created).\n\n### Troubleshooting Guide: Recommend `@Keep` for Android\nInstead of configuring ProGuard / R8 rules, it might be easier for Android developers to use `@Keep` on the corresponding class or constructor, see https://developer.android.com/studio/write/annotations#keep\n\n### Preventing R8 from making classes abstract / removing no-args constructor\n\nIt would be good if we could adjust the default rules to avoid the "Abstract classes can\'t be instantiated!" exception (for most cases) in the first place.\n\nThere is probably no general way to detect if a class might be used with Gson, but the most reliable variant might be to keep the constructor if any of the Gson annotations is used by a class.\n\nThis can probably be achieved with an [`-if` rule](https://www.guardsquare.com/manual/configuration/usage#if) (see also [answers to this Stack Overflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/q/63162818)). For example:\n```\n# If class has fields with `@SerializedName` annotation keep its constructors\n-if class * {\n  @com.google.gson.annotations.SerializedName <fields>;\n}\n-keep class <1> {\n  <init>(...);\n}\n```\n(duplicated for all Gson annotations)\n\nBut it looks like this is not enough, maybe because there is no `-keep` (or `-keepclasseswithmembers`) rule for the class in the first place so `-if` somehow has no effect? You additionally need the following (duplicated for all Gson annotations probably):\n```\n-keepclasseswithmembers class * {\n  @com.google.gson.annotations.SerializedName <fields>;\n}\n```\nOnly then the class is not made abstract and the constructor is properly kept...\n\n(As side note: Having only the `-keepclasseswithmembers ... { @SerializedName }` above, but not the `-if ... -keep` seems to prevent R8 from making the class abstract, but still removes all constructors, so users would be dependent on JDK Unsafe then.)\n\nOr similar to https://github.com/google/gson/issues/2379#issuecomment-1564517629 maybe the following would work as well:\n```\n-keepclasseswithmembers class * {\n  <init>(...);\n  @com.google.gson.annotations.SerializedName <fields>;\n}\n```\nThere is however probably no need for the `-if` rule shown in the original comment, unless that has some special effect, see https://github.com/google/gson/pull/2397#issuecomment-1575236086.\n\n### R8 makes class abstract but still keeps constructors\n\nIt also looks like the Android app build creates (for some reason) additional constructors / keeps constructors even when the class is made abstract. Due to this, the Troubleshooting Guide URLs are unfortunately not included in the exception messages (they are only added at the moment when there are no constructors).\nNot really sure why these constructors exist in the first place and are kept even when the class is made abstract. In the R8 integration test of Gson this behavior was not seen.\n\nMaybe we should remove the `getDeclaredConstructors().length == 0` check if the class is abstract and always refer to the Troubleshooting Guide. The guide would have to be adjusted then though to also properly cover the case where the class was indeed abstract in the source code.\n\n---\n\nAny additional feedback is highly appreciated!\n\n\nIssue comments:\n\n--- END ISSUE INFO ---\n\nContext Found:\n--- BEGIN CONTEXT ---\nFile: Troubleshooting.md\nLine number range: 1 - 329\nContent:\n1. # Troubleshooting Guide\n2. \n3. This guide describes how to troubleshoot common issues when using Gson.\n4. \n5. <!-- The \'<a id="..."></a>\' anchors below are used to create stable links; don\'t remove or rename them -->\n6. <!-- Use only lowercase IDs, GitHub seems to not support uppercase IDs, see also https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/50962 -->\n7. \n8. ## <a id="class-cast-exception"></a> `ClassCastException` when using deserialized object\n9. \n10. **Symptom:** `ClassCastException` is thrown when accessing an object deserialized by Gson\n11. \n12. **Reason:** Your code is most likely not type-safe\n13. \n14. **Solution:** Make sure your code adheres to the following:\n15. \n16. - Avoid raw types: Instead of calling `fromJson(..., List.class)`, create for example a `TypeToken<List<MyClass>>`.\n17.   See the [user guide](UserGuide.md#collections-examples) for more information.\n18. - When using `TypeToken` prefer the `Gson.fromJson` overloads with `TypeToken` parameter such as [`fromJson(Reader, TypeToken)`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/Gson.html#fromJson(java.io.Reader,com.google.gson.reflect.TypeToken)).\n19.   The overloads with `Type` parameter do not provide any type-safety guarantees.\n20. - When using `TypeToken` make sure you don\'t capture a type variable. For example avoid something like `new TypeToken<List<T>>()` (where `T` is a type variable). Due to Java type erasure the actual type of `T` is not available at runtime. Refactor your code to pass around `TypeToken` instances or use [`TypeToken.getParameterized(...)`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/reflect/TypeToken.html#getParameterized(java.lang.reflect.Type,java.lang.reflect.Type...)), for example `TypeToken.getParameterized(List.class, elementClass)`.\n21. \n22. ## <a id="reflection-inaccessible"></a> `InaccessibleObjectException`: \'module ... does not "opens ..." to unnamed module\'\n23. \n24. **Symptom:** An exception with a message in the form \'module ... does not "opens ..." to unnamed module\' is thrown\n25. \n26. **Reason:** You use Gson by accident to access internal fields of third-party classes\n27. \n28. **Solution:** Write custom Gson [`TypeAdapter`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html) implementations for the affected classes or change the type of your data. If this occurs for a field in one of your classes which you did not actually want to serialize or deserialize in the first place, you can exclude that field, see the [user guide](UserGuide.md#excluding-fields-from-serialization-and-deserialization).\n29. \n30. **Explanation:**\n31. \n32. When no built-in adapter for a type exists and no custom adapter has been registered, Gson falls back to using reflection to access the fields of a class (including `private` ones). Most likely you are seeing this error because you (by accident) rely on the reflection-based adapter for third-party classes. That should be avoided because you make yourself dependent on the implementation details of these classes which could change at any point. For the JDK it is also not possible anymore to access internal fields using reflection starting with JDK 17, see [JEP 403](https://openjdk.org/jeps/403).\n33. \n34. If you want to prevent using reflection on third-party classes in the future you can write your own [`ReflectionAccessFilter`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/ReflectionAccessFilter.html) or use one of the predefined ones, such as `ReflectionAccessFilter.BLOCK_ALL_PLATFORM`.\n35. \n36. ## <a id="reflection-inaccessible-to-module-gson"></a> `InaccessibleObjectException`: \'module ... does not "opens ..." to module com.google.gson\'\n37. \n38. **Symptom:** An exception with a message in the form \'module ... does not "opens ..." to module com.google.gson\' is thrown\n39. \n40. **Reason:**\n41. \n42. - If the reported package is your own package then you have not configured the module declaration of your project to allow Gson to use reflection on your classes.\n43. - If the reported package is from a third party library or the JDK see [this troubleshooting point](#inaccessibleobjectexception-module--does-not-opens--to-unnamed-module).\n44. \n45. **Solution:** Make sure the `module-info.java` file of your project allows Gson to use reflection on your classes, for example:\n46. \n47. ```java\n48. module mymodule {\n49.     requires com.google.gson;\n50. \n51.     opens mypackage to com.google.gson;\n52. }\n53. ```\n54. \n55. Or in case this occurs for a field in one of your classes which you did not actually want to serialize or deserialize in the first place, you can exclude that field, see the [user guide](UserGuide.md#excluding-fields-from-serialization-and-deserialization).\n56. \n57. ## <a id="android-app-random-names"></a> Android app not working in Release mode; random property names\n58. \n59. **Symptom:** Your Android app is working fine in Debug mode but fails in Release mode and the JSON properties have seemingly random names such as `a`, `b`, ...\n60. \n61. **Reason:** You probably have not configured ProGuard / R8 correctly\n62. \n63. **Solution:** Make sure you have configured ProGuard / R8 correctly to preserve the names of your fields. See the [Android example](examples/android-proguard-example/README.md) for more information.\n64. \n65. ## <a id="android-app-broken-after-app-update"></a> Android app unable to parse JSON after app update\n66. \n67. **Symptom:** You released a new version of your Android app and it fails to parse JSON data created by the previous version of your app\n68. \n69. **Reason:** You probably have not configured ProGuard / R8 correctly; probably the fields names are being obfuscated and their naming changed between the versions of your app\n70. \n71. **Solution:** Make sure you have configured ProGuard / R8 correctly to preserve the names of your fields. See the [Android example](examples/android-proguard-example/README.md) for more information.\n72. \n73. If you want to preserve backward compatibility for you app you can use [`@SerializedName`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/annotations/SerializedName.html) on the fields to specify the obfuscated name as alternate, for example: `@SerializedName(value = "myprop", alternate = "a")`\n74. \n75. Normally ProGuard and R8 produce a mapping file, this makes it easier to find out the obfuscated field names instead of having to find them out through trial and error or other means. See the [Android Studio user guide](https://developer.android.com/studio/build/shrink-code.html#retracing) for more information.\n76. \n77. ## <a id="default-field-values-missing"></a> Default field values not present after deserialization\n78. \n79. **Symptom:** You have assign default values to fields but after deserialization the fields have their standard value (such as `null` or `0`)\n80. \n81. **Reason:** Gson cannot invoke the constructor of your class and falls back to JDK `Unsafe` (or similar means)\n82. \n83. **Solution:** Make sure that the class:\n84. \n85. - is `static` (explicitly or implicitly when it is a top-level class)\n86. - has a no-args constructor\n87. \n88. Otherwise Gson will by default try to use JDK `Unsafe` or similar means to create an instance of your class without invoking the constructor and without running any initializers. You can also disable that behavior through [`GsonBuilder.disableJdkUnsafe()`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.html#disableJdkUnsafe()) to notice such issues early on.\n89. \n90. ## <a id="anonymous-local-null"></a> `null` values for anonymous and local classes\n91. \n92. **Symptom:** Objects of a class are always serialized as JSON `null` / always deserialized as Java `null`\n93. \n94. **Reason:** The class you are serializing or deserializing is an anonymous or a local class (or you have specified a custom `ExclusionStrategy`)\n95. \n96. **Solution:** Convert the class to a `static` nested class. If the class is already `static` make sure you have not specified a Gson `ExclusionStrategy` which might exclude the class.\n97. \n98. Notes:\n99. \n100. - "double brace-initialization" also creates anonymous classes\n101. - Local record classes (feature added in Java 16) are supported by Gson and are not affected by this\n102. \n103. ## <a id="map-key-wrong-json"></a> Map keys having unexpected format in JSON\n104. \n105. **Symptom:** JSON output for `Map` keys is unexpected / cannot be deserialized again\n106. \n107. **Reason:** The `Map` key type is \'complex\' and you have not configured the `GsonBuilder` properly\n108. \n109. **Solution:** Use [`GsonBuilder.enableComplexMapKeySerialization()`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.html#enableComplexMapKeySerialization()). See also the [user guide](UserGuide.md#maps-examples) for more information.\n110. \n111. ## <a id="malformed-json"></a> Parsing JSON fails with `MalformedJsonException`\n112. \n113. **Symptom:** JSON parsing fails with `MalformedJsonException`\n114. \n115. **Reason:** The JSON data is actually malformed\n116. \n117. **Solution:** During debugging, log the JSON data right before calling Gson methods or set a breakpoint to inspect the data and make sure it has the expected format. Sometimes APIs might return HTML error pages (instead of JSON data) when reaching rate limits or when other errors occur. Also read the location information of the `MalformedJsonException` exception message, it indicates where exactly in the document the malformed data was detected, including the [JSONPath](https://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/).\n118. \n119. For example, let\'s assume you want to deserialize the following JSON data:\n120. \n121. ```json\n122. {\n123.   "languages": [\n124.     "English",\n125.     "French",\n126.   ]\n127. }\n128. ```\n129. \n130. This will fail with an exception similar to this one: `MalformedJsonException: Use JsonReader.setLenient(true) to accept malformed JSON at line 5 column 4 path $.languages[2]`  \n131. The problem here is the trailing comma (`,`) after `"French"`, trailing commas are not allowed by the JSON specification. The location information "line 5 column 4" points to the `]` in the JSON data (with some slight inaccuracies) because Gson expected another value after `,` instead of the closing `]`. The JSONPath `$.languages[2]` in the exception message also points there: `$.` refers to the root object, `languages` refers to its member of that name and `[2]` refers to the (missing) third value in the JSON array value of that member (numbering starts at 0, so it is `[2]` instead of `[3]`).  \n132. The proper solution here is to fix the malformed JSON data.\n133. \n134. To spot syntax errors in the JSON data easily you can open it in an editor with support for JSON, for example Visual Studio Code. It will highlight within the JSON data the error location and show why the JSON data is considered invalid.\n135. \n136. ## <a id="number-parsed-as-double"></a> Integral JSON number is parsed as `double`\n137. \n138. **Symptom:** JSON data contains an integral number such as `45` but Gson returns it as `double`\n139. \n140. **Reason:** When parsing a JSON number as `Object`, Gson will by default create always return a `double`\n141. \n142. **Solution:** Use [`GsonBuilder.setObjectToNumberStrategy`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.html#setObjectToNumberStrategy(com.google.gson.ToNumberStrategy)) to specify what type of number should be returned\n143. \n144. ## <a id="default-lenient"></a> Malformed JSON not rejected\n145. \n146. **Symptom:** Gson parses malformed JSON without throwing any exceptions\n147. \n148. **Reason:** Due to legacy reasons Gson performs parsing by default in lenient mode\n149. \n150. **Solution:** See [`Gson` class documentation](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/Gson.html#default-lenient) section "Lenient JSON handling"\n151. \n152. Note: Even in non-lenient mode Gson deviates slightly from the JSON specification, see [`JsonReader.setLenient`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/stream/JsonReader.html#setLenient(boolean)) for more details.\n153. \n154. ## <a id="unexpected-json-structure"></a> `IllegalStateException`: "Expected ... but was ..."\n155. \n156. **Symptom:** An `IllegalStateException` with a message in the form "Expected ... but was ..." is thrown\n157. \n158. **Reason:** The JSON data does not have the correct format\n159. \n160. **Solution:** Make sure that your classes correctly model the JSON data. Also during debugging log the JSON data right before calling Gson methods or set a breakpoint to inspect the data and make sure it has the expected format. Read the location information of the exception message, it indicates where exactly in the document the error occurred, including the [JSONPath](https://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/).\n161. \n162. For example, let\'s assume you have the following Java class:\n163. \n164. ```java\n165. class WebPage {\n166.     String languages;\n167. }\n168. ```\n169. \n170. And you want to deserialize the following JSON data:\n171. \n172. ```json\n173. {\n174.   "languages": ["English", "French"]\n175. }\n176. ```\n177. \n178. This will fail with an exception similar to this one: `IllegalStateException: Expected a string but was BEGIN_ARRAY at line 2 column 17 path $.languages`  \n179. This means Gson expected a JSON string value but found the beginning of a JSON array (`[`). The location information "line 2 column 17" points to the `[` in the JSON data (with some slight inaccuracies), so does the JSONPath `$.languages` in the exception message. It refers to the `languages` member of the root object (`$.`).  \n180. The solution here is to change in the `WebPage` class the field `String languages` to `List<String> languages`.\n181. \n182. ## <a id="adapter-not-null-safe"></a> `IllegalStateException`: "Expected ... but was NULL"\n183. \n184. **Symptom:** An `IllegalStateException` with a message in the form "Expected ... but was NULL" is thrown\n185. \n186. **Reason:**\n187. \n188. - A built-in adapter does not support JSON null values\n189. - You have written a custom `TypeAdapter` which does not properly handle JSON null values\n190. \n191. **Solution:** If this occurs for a custom adapter you wrote, add code similar to the following at the beginning of its `read` method:\n192. \n193. ```java\n194. @Override\n195. public MyClass read(JsonReader in) throws IOException {\n196.     if (in.peek() == JsonToken.NULL) {\n197.         in.nextNull();\n198.         return null;\n199.     }\n200. \n201.     ...\n202. }\n203. ```\n204. \n205. Alternatively you can call [`nullSafe()`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html#nullSafe()) on the adapter instance you created.\n206. \n207. ## <a id="serialize-nulls"></a> Properties missing in JSON\n208. \n209. **Symptom:** Properties are missing in the JSON output\n210. \n211. **Reason:** Gson by default omits JSON null from the output (or: ProGuard / R8 is not configured correctly and removed unused fields)\n212. \n213. **Solution:** Use [`GsonBuilder.serializeNulls()`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.html#serializeNulls())\n214. \n215. Note: Gson does not support anonymous and local classes and will serialize them as JSON null, see the [related troubleshooting point](#null-values-for-anonymous-and-local-classes).\n216. \n217. ## <a id="android-internal-fields"></a> JSON output changes for newer Android versions\n218. \n219. **Symptom:** The JSON output differs when running on newer Android versions\n220. \n221. **Reason:** You use Gson by accident to access internal fields of Android classes\n222. \n223. **Solution:** Write custom Gson [`TypeAdapter`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html) implementations for the affected classes or change the type of your data\n224. \n225. **Explanation:**\n226. \n227. When no built-in adapter for a type exists and no custom adapter has been registered, Gson falls back to using reflection to access the fields of a class (including `private` ones). Most likely you are experiencing this issue because you (by accident) rely on the reflection-based adapter for Android classes. That should be avoided because you make yourself dependent on the implementation details of these classes which could change at any point.\n228. \n229. If you want to prevent using reflection on third-party classes in the future you can write your own [`ReflectionAccessFilter`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/ReflectionAccessFilter.html) or use one of the predefined ones, such as `ReflectionAccessFilter.BLOCK_ALL_PLATFORM`.\n230. \n231. ## <a id="json-static-fields"></a> JSON output contains values of `static` fields\n232. \n233. **Symptom:** The JSON output contains values of `static` fields\n234. \n235. **Reason:** You used `GsonBuilder.excludeFieldsWithModifiers` to overwrite the default excluded modifiers\n236. \n237. **Solution:** When calling `GsonBuilder.excludeFieldsWithModifiers` you overwrite the default excluded modifiers. Therefore, you have to explicitly exclude `static` fields if desired. This can be done by adding `Modifier.STATIC` as additional argument.\n238. \n239. ## <a id="no-such-method-error"></a> `NoSuchMethodError` when calling Gson methods\n240. \n241. **Symptom:** A `java.lang.NoSuchMethodError` is thrown when trying to call certain Gson methods\n242. \n243. **Reason:**\n244. \n245. - You have multiple versions of Gson on your classpath\n246. - Or, the Gson version you compiled against is different from the one on your classpath\n247. - Or, you are using a code shrinking tool such as ProGuard or R8 which removed methods from Gson\n248. \n249. **Solution:** First disable any code shrinking tools such as ProGuard or R8 and check if the issue persists. If not, you have to tweak the configuration of that tool to not modify Gson classes. Otherwise verify that the Gson JAR on your classpath is the same you are compiling against, and that there is only one Gson JAR on your classpath. See [this Stack Overflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/q/227486) to find out where a class is loaded from. For example, for debugging you could include the following code:\n250. \n251. ```java\n252. System.out.println(Gson.class.getProtectionDomain().getCodeSource().getLocation());\n253. ```\n254. \n255. If that fails with a `NullPointerException` you have to try one of the other ways to find out where a class is loaded from.\n256. \n257. ## <a id="duplicate-fields"></a> `IllegalArgumentException`: \'Class ... declares multiple JSON fields named \'...\'\'\n258. \n259. **Symptom:** An exception with the message \'Class ... declares multiple JSON fields named \'...\'\' is thrown\n260. \n261. **Reason:**\n262. \n263. - The name you have specified with a [`@SerializedName`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/annotations/SerializedName.html) annotation for a field collides with the name of another field\n264. - The [`FieldNamingStrategy`](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/FieldNamingStrategy.html) you have specified produces conflicting field names\n265. - A field of your class has the same name as the field of a superclass\n266. \n267. Gson prevents multiple fields with the same name because during deserialization it would be ambiguous for which field the JSON data should be deserialized. For serialization it would cause the same field to appear multiple times in JSON. While the JSON specification permits this, it is likely that the application parsing the JSON data will not handle it correctly.\n268. \n269. **Solution:** First identify the fields with conflicting names based on the exception message. Then decide if you want to rename one of them using the [`@SerializedName`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/annotations/SerializedName.html) annotation, or if you want to [exclude](UserGuide.md#excluding-fields-from-serialization-and-deserialization) one of them. When excluding one of the fields you have to include it for both serialization and deserialization (even if your application only performs one of these actions) because the duplicate field check cannot differentiate between these actions.\n270. \n271. ## <a id="java-lang-class-unsupported"></a> `UnsupportedOperationException` when serializing or deserializing `java.lang.Class`\n272. \n273. **Symptom:** An `UnsupportedOperationException` is thrown when trying to serialize or deserialize `java.lang.Class`\n274. \n275. **Reason:** Gson intentionally does not permit serializing and deserializing `java.lang.Class` for security reasons. Otherwise a malicious user could make your application load an arbitrary class from the classpath and, depending on what your application does with the `Class`, in the worst case perform a remote code execution attack.\n276. \n277. **Solution:** First check if you really need to serialize or deserialize a `Class`. Often it is possible to use string aliases and then map them to the known `Class`; you could write a custom [`TypeAdapter`](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html) to do this. If the `Class` values are not known in advance, try to introduce a common base class or interface for all these classes and then verify that the deserialized class is a subclass. For example assuming the base class is called `MyBaseClass`, your custom `TypeAdapter` should load the class like this:\n278. \n279. ```java\n280. Class.forName(jsonString, false, getClass().getClassLoader()).asSubclass(MyBaseClass.class)\n281. ```\n282. \n283. This will not initialize arbitrary classes, and it will throw a `ClassCastException` if the loaded class is not the same as or a subclass of `MyBaseClass`.\n284. \n285. ## <a id="type-token-raw"></a> `IllegalStateException`: \'TypeToken must be created with a type argument\' <br> `RuntimeException`: \'Missing type parameter\'\n286. \n287. **Symptom:** An `IllegalStateException` with the message \'TypeToken must be created with a type argument\' is thrown.  \n288. For older Gson versions a `RuntimeException` with message \'Missing type parameter\' is thrown.\n289. \n290. **Reason:**\n291. \n292. - You created a `TypeToken` without type argument, for example `new TypeToken() {}` (note the missing `<...>`). You always have to provide the type argument, for example like this: `new TypeToken<List<String>>() {}`. Normally the compiler will also emit a \'raw types\' warning when you forget the `<...>`.\n293. - You are using a code shrinking tool such as ProGuard or R8 (Android app builds normally have this enabled by default) but have not configured it correctly for usage with Gson.\n294. \n295. **Solution:** When you are using a code shrinking tool such as ProGuard or R8 you have to adjust your configuration to include the following rules:\n296. \n297. ```\n298. # Keep generic signatures; needed for correct type resolution\n299. -keepattributes Signature\n300. \n301. # Keep class TypeToken (respectively its generic signature)\n302. -keep class com.google.gson.reflect.TypeToken { *; }\n303. \n304. # Keep any (anonymous) classes extending TypeToken\n305. -keep class * extends com.google.gson.reflect.TypeToken\n306. ```\n307. \n308. See also the [Android example](examples/android-proguard-example/README.md) for more information.\n309. \n310. Note: For newer Gson versions these rules might be applied automatically; make sure you are using the latest Gson version and the latest version of the code shrinking tool.\n311. \n312. ## <a id="r8-abstract-class"></a> `JsonIOException`: \'Abstract classes can\'t be instantiated!\' (R8)\n313. \n314. **Symptom:** A `JsonIOException` with the message \'Abstract classes can\'t be instantiated!\' is thrown; the class mentioned in the exception message is not actually `abstract` in your source code, and you are using the code shrinking tool R8 (Android app builds normally have this configured by default).\n315. \n316. **Reason:** The code shrinking tool R8 performs optimizations where it removes the no-args constructor from a class and makes the class `abstract`. Due to this Gson cannot create an instance of the class.\n317. \n318. **Solution:** Make sure the class has a no-args constructor, then adjust your R8 configuration file to keep the constructor of the class. For example:\n319. \n320. ```\n321. # Keep the no-args constructor of the deserialized class\n322. -keepclassmembers class com.example.MyClass {\n323.   <init>();\n324. }\n325. ```\n326. \n327. For Android you can add this rule to the `proguard-rules.pro` file, see also the [Android documentation](https://developer.android.com/build/shrink-code#keep-code). In case the class name in the exception message is obfuscated, see the Android documentation about [retracing](https://developer.android.com/build/shrink-code#retracing).\n328. \n329. Note: If the class which you are trying to deserialize is actually abstract, then this exception is probably unrelated to R8 and you will have to implement a custom [`InstanceCreator`](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/InstanceCreator.html) or [`TypeAdapter`](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html) which creates an instance of a non-abstract subclass of the class.\n\n\nFile: examples/android-proguard-example/README.md\nLine number range: 1 - 17\nContent:\n1. # android-proguard-example\n2. \n3. Example Android project showing how to properly configure [ProGuard](https://www.guardsquare.com/proguard).\n4. ProGuard is a tool for \'shrinking\' and obfuscating compiled classes. It can rename methods and fields,\n5. or remove them if they appear to be unused. This can cause issues for Gson which uses Java reflection to\n6. access the fields of a class. It is necessary to configure ProGuard to make sure that Gson works correctly.\n7. \n8. Also have a look at the [ProGuard manual](https://www.guardsquare.com/manual/configuration/usage#keepoverview)\n9. and the [ProGuard Gson examples](https://www.guardsquare.com/manual/configuration/examples#gson) for more\n10. details on how ProGuard can be configured.\n11. \n12. The R8 code shrinker uses the same rule format as ProGuard, but there are differences between these two\n13. tools. Have a look at R8\'s Compatibility FAQ, and especially at the [Gson section](https://r8.googlesource.com/r8/+/refs/heads/main/compatibility-faq.md#gson).\n14. \n15. Note that newer Gson versions apply some of the rules shown in `proguard.cfg` automatically by default,\n16. see the file [`gson/META-INF/proguard/gson.pro`](/gson/src/main/resources/META-INF/proguard/gson.pro) for\n17. the Gson version you are using.\n\n\nFile: gson/src/main/java/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.java\nLine number range: 103 - 106\nContent:\n103.   private boolean generateNonExecutableJson = DEFAULT_JSON_NON_EXECUTABLE;\n104.   private boolean lenient = DEFAULT_LENIENT;\n105.   private boolean useJdkUnsafe = DEFAULT_USE_JDK_UNSAFE;\n106.   private ToNumberStrategy objectToNumberStrategy = DEFAULT_OBJECT_TO_NUMBER_STRATEGY;\n\n\nFile: gson/src/main/java/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.java\nLine number range: 756 - 760\nContent:\n756.   @CanIgnoreReturnValue\n757.   public GsonBuilder disableJdkUnsafe() {\n758.     this.useJdkUnsafe = false;\n759.     return this;\n760.   }\n\n\nFile: gson/src/main/java/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.java\nLine number range: 806 - 813\nContent:\n806.     return new Gson(excluder, fieldNamingPolicy, new HashMap<>(instanceCreators),\n807.         serializeNulls, complexMapKeySerialization,\n808.         generateNonExecutableJson, escapeHtmlChars, formattingStyle, lenient,\n809.         serializeSpecialFloatingPointValues, useJdkUnsafe, longSerializationPolicy,\n810.         datePattern, dateStyle, timeStyle, new ArrayList<>(this.factories),\n811.         new ArrayList<>(this.hierarchyFactories), factories,\n812.         objectToNumberStrategy, numberToNumberStrategy, new ArrayList<>(reflectionFilters));\n813.   }\n\n\nFile: gson/src/main/java/com/google/gson/JsonIOException.java\nLine number range: 16 - 45\nContent:\n16. package com.google.gson;\n17. \n18. /**\n19.  * This exception is raised when Gson was unable to read an input stream\n20.  * or write to one.\n21.  * \n22.  * @author Inderjeet Singh\n23.  * @author Joel Leitch\n24.  */\n25. public final class JsonIOException extends JsonParseException {\n26.   private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;\n27. \n28.   public JsonIOException(String msg) {\n29.     super(msg);\n30.   }\n31. \n32.   public JsonIOException(String msg, Throwable cause) {\n33.     super(msg, cause);\n34.   }\n35. \n36.   /**\n37.    * Creates exception with the specified cause.

Do NOT explore for more context in the codebase!\n\nAnalyzer agent has analyzed the issue and provided instruction on the issue:\n--- BEGIN ANALYZER MESSAGE ---\nBelow is a high-level description of what needs to be implemented to address the feature request “Improve default ProGuard / R8 rules and Troubleshooting Guide”.\n\n1) Feature Understanding\n\n- Goal: Reduce/avoid R8-induced “Abstract classes can\'t be instantiated!” failures in Gson by:\n  - Improving default ProGuard/R8 rules bundled in META-INF/proguard/gson.pro so constructors of likely-Gson-classes aren’t removed and classes aren’t made abstract.\n  - Improving Troubleshooting.md to present more accurate and actionable guidance (Kotlin, @Keep, -keep vs -keepclassmembers, constructor patterns).\n  - Optionally adjusting exception messaging so that users are always routed to the Troubleshooting Guide in the “abstract” class path, even when R8 has left some constructors in place.\n\n- Requirements and desired behavior:\n  - Default rules should proactively keep constructors for classes that are likely used with Gson, detected via the presence of Gson annotations (e.g., @SerializedName, @Expose, @Since, @Until, @JsonAdapter).\n  - Troubleshooting guidance should:\n    - Explain that many Kotlin classes do not have a no-args constructor and that Gson may use JDK Unsafe by default to instantiate them.\n    - Clarify when to use -keep vs -keepclassmembers and whether to keep one or all constructors (<init>(); vs <init>(...);) to avoid R8 side effects.\n    - Recommend Android’s @Keep annotation as a simpler alternative.\n    - Provide robust ProGuard/R8 rule examples, including -if rules and the need to combine them with -keepclasseswithmembers.\n  - Error messages for the “abstract class” case should consistently include the Troubleshooting Guide URL even if constructors exist, because users can encounter “abstract” outcomes despite some constructors being retained by R8.\n\n- Ambiguities and edge cases to cover:\n  - Kotlin classes with only a primary constructor: clarify interaction with GsonBuilder.disableJdkUnsafe().\n  - When @SerializedName is present on methods vs fields: Gson’s ReflectiveTypeAdapterFactory does not support @SerializedName on methods unless the field also has it (and will throw), so be careful in examples to focus on fields.\n  - R8 behavior differences between “only -keepclasseswithmembers” vs “-if + -keep” vs combinations; document a conservative/default approach to cover both keeping classes non-abstract and keeping constructors.\n  - Truly abstract classes: clarify that users still need InstanceCreator/TypeAdapter and that the Troubleshooting section applies to both genuine abstract classes and R8-transformed ones.\n\n2) Architecture Analysis\n\n- Components affected:\n  - Default ProGuard/R8 rules resource:\n    - File: gson/src/main/resources/META-INF/proguard/gson.pro\n  - Documentation:\n    - File: Troubleshooting.md (update the section with anchor id r8-abstract-class and related Android/ProGuard references).\n    - File: examples/android-proguard-example/README.md (note new defaults and alternatives like @Keep).\n  - Error message routing (optional but recommended for consistency):\n    - File: gson/src/main/java/com/google/gson/internal/ConstructorConstructor.java (method checkInstantiable and related message return paths).\n\n- Integration with existing code:\n  - The gson.pro bundled rules are picked up automatically by tools that honor META-INF/proguard entries (modern Android builds/R8).\n  - The TroubleshootingGuide.createUrl("...") mechanism already exists; we only need to ensure “abstract” path includes the link consistently.\n  - No runtime logic changes are required beyond improving message text in ConstructorConstructor; all instantiation behavior remains the same.\n\n- Conventions and constraints:\n  - gson.pro must remain conservative to avoid over-keeping classes or breaking obfuscation unnecessarily. Focus on classes with Gson annotations to scope impact.\n  - Documentation needs stable anchors (existing pattern with lowercase IDs).\n  - Maintain backward compatibility with existing public APIs and behaviors; only error message text changes may affect tests relying on exact strings.\n\n3) Implementation Plan\n\nA) Improve default ProGuard/R8 rules\n\n- File to modify: gson/src/main/resources/META-INF/proguard/gson.pro\n\n- Changes to implement:\n  - Add rules that detect classes likely used by Gson (via annotations) and:\n    - Prevent R8 from making them abstract.\n    - Keep their constructors, preferably all constructors (<init>(...);) to avoid mismatches where no-args don’t exist (Kotlin primary constructor scenario).\n  - Use a conservative two-pronged approach since real-world reports indicate -if alone was not sufficient:\n    - For each relevant annotation, add:\n      - An -if rule that matches classes with a Gson annotation and a corresponding -keep rule to keep all constructors:\n        - Examples (no code to paste): for @SerializedName, @Expose, @Since, @Until on fields; for @JsonAdapter on classes or fields.\n      - A keepclasseswithmembers rule matching classes with those annotations to ensure they are not made abstract even if the constructor pattern match is tricky. Consider allowobfuscation variants to avoid unintended name retention.\n  - Scope:\n    - Fields: @com.google.gson.annotations.SerializedName, @com.google.gson.annotations.Expose, @com.google.gson.annotations.Since, @com.google.gson.annotations.Until\n    - Types: @com.google.gson.annotations.JsonAdapter (on class)\n    - Note: @SerializedName also targets methods, but Gson currently errors when only methods are annotated without field annotations. Favor field-based matching in default rules.\n  - Explicitly keep constructors via <init>(...); rather than only <init>(); to cover Kotlin classes without a no-args constructor. This reduces surprises where R8 removes constructors and Gson falls back to Unsafe or fails when Unsafe is disabled.\n  - Keep obfuscation allowed unless field names must be preserved manually. The default rules should not globally prevent obfuscation; instruct users to preserve field names as needed (documented in the Android example and Troubleshooting.md).\n\n- Why this works:\n  - The combination of -if + -keep ensures constructors are preserved for classes using Gson annotations.\n  - The additional -keepclasseswithmembers for the same annotation patterns helps prevent the class from being made abstract and supports scenarios observed where constructors persisted but abstract transformation still occurred.\n  - Limiting to classes with Gson annotations focuses the impact to likely Gson-mapped classes without bloating the app.\n\nB) Update the Troubleshooting Guide\n\n- File to modify: Troubleshooting.md\n\n- Sections to update:\n  - r8-abstract-class (anchor id: r8-abstract-class).\n  - Android and ProGuard/R8 related sections (cross-link to the Android example and gson.pro).\n\n- Content changes:\n  - Replace/augment the current recommendation that only keeps a no-args constructor with:\n    - Recommendation to keep all constructors (<init>(...);) to handle Kotlin classes and avoid R8 edge cases where no no-args exists.\n    - Highlight the difference between -keep vs -keepclassmembers:\n      - -keep can help prevent R8 from making the class abstract even when a constructor signature doesn’t match.\n      - If you know the exact classes, -keep class com.example.MyClass { <init>(...); } is often safer.\n    - Present a robust pattern using -if and a paired -keepclasseswithmembers for classes using Gson annotations (e.g., @SerializedName). Make clear that for most cases, configuring rules for annotations is the most reliable general solution.\n    - Clarify Kotlin implications:\n      - Many Kotlin classes lack a no-args constructor. Gson may use JDK Unsafe by default to construct them.\n      - If GsonBuilder.disableJdkUnsafe() is enabled, users must supply a no-args constructor or a custom InstanceCreator/TypeAdapter.\n    - Recommend Android’s @Keep annotation as a simpler option:\n      - Suggest applying @Keep on the class or constructor in Android projects to avoid the need for ProGuard/R8 configuration per class (link: https://developer.android.com/studio/write/annotations#keep).\n    - Mention that R8 might still keep constructors even when making classes abstract; advise that the presence of the “abstract” error message with a Troubleshooting link is normal and to follow the steps provided.\n    - Reiterate the guidance for truly abstract classes: if the class is actually abstract in source, users need an InstanceCreator or TypeAdapter for a concrete subtype.\n\n- Rationale:\n  - Provides clear, actionable steps for common scenarios, including Kotlin and Android specifics.\n  - Reduces confusion caused by having only the no-args constructor sample.\n  - Improves success rate in real-world R8 builds by documenting robust rule combinations.\n\nC) Update Android example readme\n\n- File to modify: examples/android-proguard-example/README.md\n\n- Changes to implement:\n  - Add a note that newer Gson versions apply additional default rules (via META-INF/proguard/gson.pro) to keep constructors for classes using Gson annotations, reducing the likelihood of “abstract” issues.\n  - Show or refer to the annotation-based pattern and mention @Keep as an alternative.\n  - Clarify that obfuscation and shrinking still occur; field name preservation may still require specific rules or use of @SerializedName with stable names.\n\nD) Improve exception messaging to always reference the Troubleshooting Guide (optional but recommended)\n\n- File to modify: gson/src/main/java/com/google/gson/internal/ConstructorConstructor.java\n\n- Functions/blocks to change:\n  - Method: checkInstantiable(Class<?> c)\n    - Current behavior: Adds Troubleshooting link only if the class is abstract and getDeclaredConstructors().length == 0; otherwise returns an abstract-class message without a link.\n    - Change: Whenever Modifier.isAbstract(modifiers) is true, ensure the returned message includes a reference to the Troubleshooting Guide URL (TroubleshootingGuide.createUrl("r8-abstract-class")), regardless of constructor count.\n    - Keep separate clarity for real abstract classes vs R8-affected ones in the message text as appropriate, but always include the URL.\n\n- Integration:\n  - This only affects messages surfaced via JsonIOException thrown by ObjectConstructor implementations and UnsafeAllocator. No behavior change for construction; only message content is updated.\n\n4) Considerations\n\n- Potential impacts:\n  - Default rules addition:\n    - Slight increase in kept constructors for classes using Gson annotations; should be minimal and acceptable.\n    - We deliberately avoid global keep rules; only classes with Gson annotations are targeted to minimize the footprint.\n  - Error message text change:\n    - If there are tests or user code matching exact error strings, those may need to be updated to the new wording. Keep the structure similar; only add the troubleshooting link consistently.\n\n- Backward compatibility:\n  - No public API changes.\n  - Default behavior remains unchanged; only shipping rules and doc guidance change. Messages include links more consistently.\n\n- Dependencies and prerequisites:\n  - Ensure the gson.pro syntax is compatible with both ProGuard and R8 (the targeted rules use common constructs: -if, -keep, -keepclasseswithmembers).\n  - Confirm that the META-INF/proguard/gson.pro file is packaged and honored by the build tools (already the case in recent versions).\n  - Keep documentation anchors stable (use existing id r8-abstract-class).\n  - Make sure the Troubleshooting Guide addresses both R8-modified and truly abstract-class scenarios.\n\nSummary of files and changes\n\n- gson/src/main/resources/META-INF/proguard/gson.pro\n  - Add annotation-based -if rules that keep all constructors of classes using Gson annotations.\n  - Add corresponding -keepclasseswithmembers rules for the same annotations to prevent classes from being made abstract.\n  - Limit scope to fields (and classes for @JsonAdapter) to align with Gson behavior; allow obfuscation unless explicitly needed otherwise.\n\n- Troubleshooting.md\n  - Update section with id r8-abstract-class:\n    - Recommend keeping all constructors (<init>(...);).\n    - Discuss -keep vs -keepclassmembers trade-offs.\n    - Provide robust annotation-based rule patterns (-if + -keepclasseswithmembers).\n    - Add Kotlin/Unsafe guidance and Android @Keep recommendation.\n    - Cover both R8-abstract and truly abstract cases.\n\n- examples/android-proguard-example/README.md\n  - Note enhanced default rules in gson.pro.\n  - Include guidance on @Keep and annotation-based patterns.\n  - Clarify implications for field name obfuscation and @SerializedName.\n\n- gson/src/main/java/com/google/gson/internal/ConstructorConstructor.java\n  - In checkInstantiable, ensure the abstract-class case always includes the Troubleshooting Guide URL, regardless of constructor presence.\n\nThis plan aligns the shipped defaults with common Android/R8 realities, gives developers clearer guidance, and reduces the frequency of “abstract class” instantiation failures without broadly disabling shrinking/obfuscation.\n--- END ANALYZER MESSAGE ---\n\nIMPORTANT INSTRUCTION:\n- The context provided above should be sufficient for you to make the required code edits.

-# Troubleshooting Guide
-
-This guide describes how to troubleshoot common issues when using Gson.

-## <a id="class-cast-exception"></a> `ClassCastException` when using deserialized object
-
-**Symptom:** `ClassCastException` is thrown when accessing an object deserialized by Gson
-
-**Reason:** Your code is most likely not type-safe
-
-**Solution:** Make sure your code adheres to the following:
-
-- Avoid raw types: Instead of calling `fromJson(..., List.class)`, create for example a `TypeToken<List<MyClass>>`.
-  See the [user guide](UserGuide.md#collections-examples) for more information.
-- When using `TypeToken` prefer the `Gson.fromJson` overloads with `TypeToken` parameter such as [`fromJson(Reader, TypeToken)`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/Gson.html#fromJson(java.io.Reader,com.google.gson.reflect.TypeToken)).
-  The overloads with `Type` parameter do not provide any type-safety guarantees.
-- When using `TypeToken` make sure you don't capture a type variable. For example avoid something like `new TypeToken<List<T>>()` (where `T` is a type variable). Due to Java type erasure the actual type of `T` is not available at runtime. Refactor your code to pass around `TypeToken` instances or use [`TypeToken.getParameterized(...)`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/reflect/TypeToken.html#getParameterized(java.lang.reflect.Type,java.lang.reflect.Type...)), for example `TypeToken.getParameterized(List.class, elementClass)`.
-
-## <a id="reflection-inaccessible"></a> `InaccessibleObjectException`: 'module ... does not "opens ..." to unnamed module'
-
-**Symptom:** An exception with a message in the form 'module ... does not "opens ..." to unnamed module' is thrown
-
-**Reason:** You use Gson by accident to access internal fields of third-party classes
-
-**Solution:** Write custom Gson [`TypeAdapter`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html) implementations for the affected classes or change the type of your data. If this occurs for a field in one of your classes which you did not actually want to serialize or deserialize in the first place, you can exclude that field, see the [user guide](UserGuide.md#excluding-fields-from-serialization-and-deserialization).
-
-**Explanation:**
-
-When no built-in adapter for a type exists and no custom adapter has been registered, Gson falls back to using reflection to access the fields of a class (including `private` ones). Most likely you are seeing this error because you (by accident) rely on the reflection-based adapter for third-party classes. That should be avoided because you make yourself dependent on the implementation details of these classes which could change at any point. For the JDK it is also not possible anymore to access internal fields using reflection starting with JDK 17, see [JEP 403](https://openjdk.org/jeps/403).
-
-If you want to prevent using reflection on third-party classes in the future you can write your own [`ReflectionAccessFilter`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/ReflectionAccessFilter.html) or use one of the predefined ones, such as `ReflectionAccessFilter.BLOCK_ALL_PLATFORM`.
-
-## <a id="reflection-inaccessible-to-module-gson"></a> `InaccessibleObjectException`: 'module ... does not "opens ..." to module com.google.gson'
-
-**Symptom:** An exception with a message in the form 'module ... does not "opens ..." to module com.google.gson' is thrown
-
-**Reason:**
-
-- If the reported package is your own package then you have not configured the module declaration of your project to allow Gson to use reflection on your classes.
-- If the reported package is from a third party library or the JDK see [this troubleshooting point](#inaccessibleobjectexception-module--does-not-opens--to-unnamed-module).
-
-**Solution:** Make sure the `module-info.java` file of your project allows Gson to use reflection on your classes, for example:
-
-```java
-module mymodule {
-    requires com.google.gson;
-
-    opens mypackage to com.google.gson;
-}
-```
-
-Or in case this occurs for a field in one of your classes which you did not actually want to serialize or deserialize in the first place, you can exclude that field, see the [user guide](UserGuide.md#excluding-fields-from-serialization-and-deserialization).
-
-## <a id="android-app-random-names"></a> Android app not working in Release mode; random property names
-
-**Symptom:** Your Android app is working fine in Debug mode but fails in Release mode and the JSON properties have seemingly random names such as `a`, `b`, ...
-
-**Reason:** You probably have not configured ProGuard / R8 correctly
-
-**Solution:** Make sure you have configured ProGuard / R8 correctly to preserve the names of your fields. See the [Android example](examples/android-proguard-example/README.md) for more information.
-
-## <a id="android-app-broken-after-app-update"></a> Android app unable to parse JSON after app update
-
-**Symptom:** You released a new version of your Android app and it fails to parse JSON data created by the previous version of your app
-
-**Reason:** You probably have not configured ProGuard / R8 correctly; probably the fields names are being obfuscated and their naming changed between the versions of your app
-
-**Solution:** Make sure you have configured ProGuard / R8 correctly to preserve the names of your fields. See the [Android example](examples/android-proguard-example/README.md) for more information.
-
-If you want to preserve backward compatibility for you app you can use [`@SerializedName`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/annotations/SerializedName.html) on the fields to specify the obfuscated name as alternate, for example: `@SerializedName(value = "myprop", alternate = "a")`
-
-Normally ProGuard and R8 produce a mapping file, this makes it easier to find out the obfuscated field names instead of having to find them out through trial and error or other means. See the [Android Studio user guide](https://developer.android.com/studio/build/shrink-code.html#retracing) for more information.
-
-## <a id="default-field-values-missing"></a> Default field values not present after deserialization
-
-**Symptom:** You have assign default values to fields but after deserialization the fields have their standard value (such as `null` or `0`)
-
-**Reason:** Gson cannot invoke the constructor of your class and falls back to JDK `Unsafe` (or similar means)
-
-**Solution:** Make sure that the class:
-
-- is `static` (explicitly or implicitly when it is a top-level class)
-- has a no-args constructor
-
-Otherwise Gson will by default try to use JDK `Unsafe` or similar means to create an instance of your class without invoking the constructor and without running any initializers. You can also disable that behavior through [`GsonBuilder.disableJdkUnsafe()`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.html#disableJdkUnsafe()) to notice such issues early on.
-
-## <a id="anonymous-local-null"></a> `null` values for anonymous and local classes
-
-**Symptom:** Objects of a class are always serialized as JSON `null` / always deserialized as Java `null`
-
-**Reason:** The class you are serializing or deserializing is an anonymous or a local class (or you have specified a custom `ExclusionStrategy`)
-
-**Solution:** Convert the class to a `static` nested class. If the class is already `static` make sure you have not specified a Gson `ExclusionStrategy` which might exclude the class.
-
-Notes:
-
-- "double brace-initialization" also creates anonymous classes
-- Local record classes (feature added in Java 16) are supported by Gson and are not affected by this
-
-## <a id="map-key-wrong-json"></a> Map keys having unexpected format in JSON
-
-**Symptom:** JSON output for `Map` keys is unexpected / cannot be deserialized again
-
-**Reason:** The `Map` key type is 'complex' and you have not configured the `GsonBuilder` properly
-
-**Solution:** Use [`GsonBuilder.enableComplexMapKeySerialization()`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.html#enableComplexMapKeySerialization()). See also the [user guide](UserGuide.md#maps-examples) for more information.
-
-## <a id="malformed-json"></a> Parsing JSON fails with `MalformedJsonException`
-
-**Symptom:** JSON parsing fails with `MalformedJsonException`
-
-**Reason:** The JSON data is actually malformed
-
-**Solution:** During debugging, log the JSON data right before calling Gson methods or set a breakpoint to inspect the data and make sure it has the expected format. Sometimes APIs might return HTML error pages (instead of JSON data) when reaching rate limits or when other errors occur. Also read the location information of the `MalformedJsonException` exception message, it indicates where exactly in the document the malformed data was detected, including the [JSONPath](https://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/).
-
-For example, let's assume you want to deserialize the following JSON data:
-
-```json
-{
-  "languages": [
-    "English",
-    "French",
-  ]
-}
-```
-
-This will fail with an exception similar to this one: `MalformedJsonException: Use JsonReader.setLenient(true) to accept malformed JSON at line 5 column 4 path $.languages[2]`  
-The problem here is the trailing comma (`,`) after `"French"`, trailing commas are not allowed by the JSON specification. The location information "line 5 column 4" points to the `]` in the JSON data (with some slight inaccuracies) because Gson expected another value after `,` instead of the closing `]`. The JSONPath `$.languages[2]` in the exception message also points there: `$.` refers to the root object, `languages` refers to its member of that name and `[2]` refers to the (missing) third value in the JSON array value of that member (numbering starts at 0, so it is `[2]` instead of `[3]`).  
-The proper solution here is to fix the malformed JSON data.
-
-To spot syntax errors in the JSON data easily you can open it in an editor with support for JSON, for example Visual Studio Code. It will highlight within the JSON data the error location and show why the JSON data is considered invalid.
-
-## <a id="number-parsed-as-double"></a> Integral JSON number is parsed as `double`
-
-**Symptom:** JSON data contains an integral number such as `45` but Gson returns it as `double`
-
-**Reason:** When parsing a JSON number as `Object`, Gson will by default create always return a `double`
-
-**Solution:** Use [`GsonBuilder.setObjectToNumberStrategy`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.html#setObjectToNumberStrategy(com.google.gson.ToNumberStrategy)) to specify what type of number should be returned
-
-## <a id="default-lenient"></a> Malformed JSON not rejected
-
-**Symptom:** Gson parses malformed JSON without throwing any exceptions
-
-**Reason:** Due to legacy reasons Gson performs parsing by default in lenient mode
-
-**Solution:** See [`Gson` class documentation](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/Gson.html#default-lenient) section "Lenient JSON handling"
-
-Note: Even in non-lenient mode Gson deviates slightly from the JSON specification, see [`JsonReader.setLenient`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/stream/JsonReader.html#setLenient(boolean)) for more details.
-
-## <a id="unexpected-json-structure"></a> `IllegalStateException`: "Expected ... but was ..."
-
-**Symptom:** An `IllegalStateException` with a message in the form "Expected ... but was ..." is thrown
-
-**Reason:** The JSON data does not have the correct format
-
-**Solution:** Make sure that your classes correctly model the JSON data. Also during debugging log the JSON data right before calling Gson methods or set a breakpoint to inspect the data and make sure it has the expected format. Read the location information of the exception message, it indicates where exactly in the document the error occurred, including the [JSONPath](https://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/).
-
-For example, let's assume you have the following Java class:
-
-```java
-class WebPage {
-    String languages;
-}
-```
-
-And you want to deserialize the following JSON data:
-
-```json
-{
-  "languages": ["English", "French"]
-}
-```
-
-This will fail with an exception similar to this one: `IllegalStateException: Expected a string but was BEGIN_ARRAY at line 2 column 17 path $.languages`  
-This means Gson expected a JSON string value but found the beginning of a JSON array (`[`). The location information "line 2 column 17" points to the `[` in the JSON data (with some slight inaccuracies), so does the JSONPath `$.languages` in the exception message. It refers to the `languages` member of the root object (`$.`).  
-The solution here is to change in the `WebPage` class the field `String languages` to `List<String> languages`.
-
-## <a id="adapter-not-null-safe"></a> `IllegalStateException`: "Expected ... but was NULL"
-
-**Symptom:** An `IllegalStateException` with a message in the form "Expected ... but was NULL" is thrown
-
-**Reason:**
-
-- A built-in adapter does not support JSON null values
-- You have written a custom `TypeAdapter` which does not properly handle JSON null values
-
-**Solution:** If this occurs for a custom adapter you wrote, add code similar to the following at the beginning of its `read` method:
-
-```java
-@Override
-public MyClass read(JsonReader in) throws IOException {
-    if (in.peek() == JsonToken.NULL) {
-        in.nextNull();
-        return null;
-    }
-
-    ...
-}
-```
-
-Alternatively you can call [`nullSafe()`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html#nullSafe()) on the adapter instance you created.
-
-## <a id="serialize-nulls"></a> Properties missing in JSON
-
-**Symptom:** Properties are missing in the JSON output
-
-**Reason:** Gson by default omits JSON null from the output (or: ProGuard / R8 is not configured correctly and removed unused fields)
-
-**Solution:** Use [`GsonBuilder.serializeNulls()`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.html#serializeNulls())
-
-Note: Gson does not support anonymous and local classes and will serialize them as JSON null, see the [related troubleshooting point](#null-values-for-anonymous-and-local-classes).
-
-## <a id="android-internal-fields"></a> JSON output changes for newer Android versions
-
-**Symptom:** The JSON output differs when running on newer Android versions
-
-**Reason:** You use Gson by accident to access internal fields of Android classes
-
-**Solution:** Write custom Gson [`TypeAdapter`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html) implementations for the affected classes or change the type of your data
-
-**Explanation:**
-
-When no built-in adapter for a type exists and no custom adapter has been registered, Gson falls back to using reflection to access the fields of a class (including `private` ones). Most likely you are experiencing this issue because you (by accident) rely on the reflection-based adapter for Android classes. That should be avoided because you make yourself dependent on the implementation details of these classes which could change at any point.
-
-If you want to prevent using reflection on third-party classes in the future you can write your own [`ReflectionAccessFilter`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/ReflectionAccessFilter.html) or use one of the predefined ones, such as `ReflectionAccessFilter.BLOCK_ALL_PLATFORM`.
-
-## <a id="json-static-fields"></a> JSON output contains values of `static` fields
-
-**Symptom:** The JSON output contains values of `static` fields
-
-**Reason:** You used `GsonBuilder.excludeFieldsWithModifiers` to overwrite the default excluded modifiers
-
-**Solution:** When calling `GsonBuilder.excludeFieldsWithModifiers` you overwrite the default excluded modifiers. Therefore, you have to explicitly exclude `static` fields if desired. This can be done by adding `Modifier.STATIC` as additional argument.
-
-## <a id="no-such-method-error"></a> `NoSuchMethodError` when calling Gson methods
-
-**Symptom:** A `java.lang.NoSuchMethodError` is thrown when trying to call certain Gson methods
-
-**Reason:**
-
-- You have multiple versions of Gson on your classpath
-- Or, the Gson version you compiled against is different from the one on your classpath
-- Or, you are using a code shrinking tool such as ProGuard or R8 which removed methods from Gson
-
-**Solution:** First disable any code shrinking tools such as ProGuard or R8 and check if the issue persists. If not, you have to tweak the configuration of that tool to not modify Gson classes. Otherwise verify that the Gson JAR on your classpath is the same you are compiling against, and that there is only one Gson JAR on your classpath. See [this Stack Overflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/q/227486) to find out where a class is loaded from. For example, for debugging you could include the following code:
-
-```java
-System.out.println(Gson.class.getProtectionDomain().getCodeSource().getLocation());
-```
-
-If that fails with a `NullPointerException` you have to try one of the other ways to find out where a class is loaded from.
-
-## <a id="duplicate-fields"></a> `IllegalArgumentException`: 'Class ... declares multiple JSON fields named '...''
-
-**Symptom:** An exception with the message 'Class ... declares multiple JSON fields named '...'' is thrown
-
-**Reason:**
-
-- The name you have specified with a [`@SerializedName`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/annotations/SerializedName.html) annotation for a field collides with the name of another field
-- The [`FieldNamingStrategy`](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/FieldNamingStrategy.html) you have specified produces conflicting field names
-- A field of your class has the same name as the field of a superclass
-
-Gson prevents multiple fields with the same name because during deserialization it would be ambiguous for which field the JSON data should be deserialized. For serialization it would cause the same field to appear multiple times in JSON. While the JSON specification permits this, it is likely that the application parsing the JSON data will not handle it correctly.
-
-**Solution:** First identify the fields with conflicting names based on the exception message. Then decide if you want to rename one of them using the [`@SerializedName`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/annotations/SerializedName.html) annotation, or if you want to [exclude](UserGuide.md#excluding-fields-from-serialization-and-deserialization) one of them. When excluding one of the fields you have to include it for both serialization and deserialization (even if your application only performs one of these actions) because the duplicate field check cannot differentiate between these actions.
-
-## <a id="java-lang-class-unsupported"></a> `UnsupportedOperationException` when serializing or deserializing `java.lang.Class`
-
-**Symptom:** An `UnsupportedOperationException` is thrown when trying to serialize or deserialize `java.lang.Class`
-
-**Reason:** Gson intentionally does not permit serializing and deserializing `java.lang.Class` for security reasons. Otherwise a malicious user could make your application load an arbitrary class from the classpath and, depending on what your application does with the `Class`, in the worst case perform a remote code execution attack.
-
-**Solution:** First check if you really need to serialize or deserialize a `Class`. Often it is possible to use string aliases and then map them to the known `Class`; you could write a custom [`TypeAdapter`](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html) to do this. If the `Class` values are not known in advance, try to introduce a common base class or interface for all these classes and then verify that the deserialized class is a subclass. For example assuming the base class is called `MyBaseClass`, your custom `TypeAdapter` should load the class like this:
-
-```java
-Class.forName(jsonString, false, getClass().getClassLoader()).asSubclass(MyBaseClass.class)
-```
-
-This will not initialize arbitrary classes, and it will throw a `ClassCastException` if the loaded class is not the same as or a subclass of `MyBaseClass`.
-
-## <a id="type-token-raw"></a> `IllegalStateException`: 'TypeToken must be created with a type argument' <br> `RuntimeException`: 'Missing type parameter'
-
-**Symptom:** An `IllegalStateException` with the message 'TypeToken must be created with a type argument' is thrown.  
-For older Gson versions a `RuntimeException` with message 'Missing type parameter' is thrown.
-
-**Reason:**
-
-- You created a `TypeToken` without type argument, for example `new TypeToken() {}` (note the missing `<...>`). You always have to provide the type argument, for example like this: `new TypeToken<List<String>>() {}`. Normally the compiler will also emit a 'raw types' warning when you forget the `<...>`.
-- You are using a code shrinking tool such as ProGuard or R8 (Android app builds normally have this enabled by default) but have not configured it correctly for usage with Gson.
-
-**Solution:** When you are using a code shrinking tool such as ProGuard or R8 you have to adjust your configuration to include the following rules:
-
-```
-# Keep generic signatures; needed for correct type resolution
--keepattributes Signature
-
-# Keep class TypeToken (respectively its generic signature)
--keep class com.google.gson.reflect.TypeToken { *; }
-
-# Keep any (anonymous) classes extending TypeToken
--keep class * extends com.google.gson.reflect.TypeToken
-```
-
-See also the [Android example](examples/android-proguard-example/README.md) for more information.
-
-Note: For newer Gson versions these rules might be applied automatically; make sure you are using the latest Gson version and the latest version of the code shrinking tool.
-
-## <a id="r8-abstract-class"></a> `JsonIOException`: 'Abstract classes can't be instantiated!' (R8)
-
-**Symptom:** A `JsonIOException` with the message 'Abstract classes can't be instantiated!' is thrown; the class mentioned in the exception message is not actually `abstract` in your source code, and you are using the code shrinking tool R8 (Android app builds normally have this configured by default).
-
-**Reason:** The code shrinking tool R8 performs optimizations where it removes the no-args constructor from a class and makes the class `abstract`. Due to this Gson cannot create an instance of the class.
-
-**Solution:** Make sure the class has a no-args constructor, then adjust your R8 configuration file to keep the constructor of the class. For example:
-
-```
-# Keep the no-args constructor of the deserialized class
--keepclassmembers class com.example.MyClass {
-  <init>();
-}
-```
-
-For Android you can add this rule to the `proguard-rules.pro` file, see also the [Android documentation](https://developer.android.com/build/shrink-code#keep-code). In case the class name in the exception message is obfuscated, see the Android documentation about [retracing](https://developer.android.com/build/shrink-code#retracing).
-
-Note: If the class which you are trying to deserialize is actually abstract, then this exception is probably unrelated to R8 and you will have to implement a custom [`InstanceCreator`](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/InstanceCreator.html) or [`TypeAdapter`](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html) which creates an instance of a non-abstract subclass of the class.

+
+## <a id="class-cast-exception"></a> `ClassCastException` when using deserialized object
+
+**Symptom:** `ClassCastException` is thrown when accessing an object deserialized by Gson
+
+**Reason:** Your code is most likely not type-safe
+
+**Solution:** Make sure your code adheres to the following:
+
+- Avoid raw types: Instead of calling `fromJson(..., List.class)`, create for example a `TypeToken<List<MyClass>>`.
+  See the [user guide](UserGuide.md#collections-examples) for more information.
+- When using `TypeToken` prefer the `Gson.fromJson` overloads with `TypeToken` parameter such as [`fromJson(Reader, TypeToken)`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/Gson.html#fromJson(java.io.Reader,com.google.gson.reflect.TypeToken)).
+  The overloads with `Type` parameter do not provide any type-safety guarantees.
+- When using `TypeToken` make sure you don't capture a type variable. For example avoid something like `new TypeToken<List<T>>()` (where `T` is a type variable). Due to Java type erasure the actual type of `T` is not available at runtime. Refactor your code to pass around `TypeToken` instances or use [`TypeToken.getParameterized(...)`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/reflect/TypeToken.html#getParameterized(java.lang.reflect.Type,java.lang.reflect.Type...)), for example `TypeToken.getParameterized(List.class, elementClass)`.
+
+## <a id="reflection-inaccessible"></a> `InaccessibleObjectException`: 'module ... does not "opens ..." to unnamed module'
+
+**Symptom:** An exception with a message in the form 'module ... does not "opens ..." to unnamed module' is thrown
+
+**Reason:** You use Gson by accident to access internal fields of third-party classes
+
+**Solution:** Write custom Gson [`TypeAdapter`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html) implementations for the affected classes or change the type of your data. If this occurs for a field in one of your classes which you did not actually want to serialize or deserialize in the first place, you can exclude that field, see the [user guide](UserGuide.md#excluding-fields-from-serialization-and-deserialization).
+
+**Explanation:**
+
+When no built-in adapter for a type exists and no custom adapter has been registered, Gson falls back to using reflection to access the fields of a class (including `private` ones). Most likely you are seeing this error because you (by accident) rely on the reflection-based adapter for third-party classes. That should be avoided because you make yourself dependent on the implementation details of these classes which could change at any point. For the JDK it is also not possible anymore to access internal fields using reflection starting with JDK 17, see [JEP 403](https://openjdk.org/jeps/403).
+
+If you want to prevent using reflection on third-party classes in the future you can write your own [`ReflectionAccessFilter`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/ReflectionAccessFilter.html) or use one of the predefined ones, such as `ReflectionAccessFilter.BLOCK_ALL_PLATFORM`.
+
+## <a id="reflection-inaccessible-to-module-gson"></a> `InaccessibleObjectException`: 'module ... does not "opens ..." to module com.google.gson'
+
+**Symptom:** An exception with a message in the form 'module ... does not "opens ..." to module com.google.gson' is thrown
+
+**Reason:**
+
+- If the reported package is your own package then you have not configured the module declaration of your project to allow Gson to use reflection on your classes.
+- If the reported package is from a third party library or the JDK see [this troubleshooting point](#inaccessibleobjectexception-module--does-not-opens--to-unnamed-module).
+
+**Solution:** Make sure the `module-info.java` file of your project allows Gson to use reflection on your classes, for example:
+
+```java
+module mymodule {
+    requires com.google.gson;
+
+    opens mypackage to com.google.gson;
+}
+```
+
+Or in case this occurs for a field in one of your classes which you did not actually want to serialize or deserialize in the first place, you can exclude that field, see the [user guide](UserGuide.md#excluding-fields-from-serialization-and-deserialization).
+
+## <a id="android-app-random-names"></a> Android app not working in Release mode; random property names
+
+**Symptom:** Your Android app is working fine in Debug mode but fails in Release mode and the JSON properties have seemingly random names such as `a`, `b`, ...
+
+**Reason:** You probably have not configured ProGuard / R8 correctly
+
+**Solution:** Make sure you have configured ProGuard / R8 correctly to preserve the names of your fields. See the [Android example](examples/android-proguard-example/README.md) for more information.
+
+## <a id="android-app-broken-after-app-update"></a> Android app unable to parse JSON after app update
+
+**Symptom:** You released a new version of your Android app and it fails to parse JSON data created by the previous version of your app
+
+**Reason:** You probably have not configured ProGuard / R8 correctly; probably the fields names are being obfuscated and their naming changed between the versions of your app
+
+**Solution:** Make sure you have configured ProGuard / R8 correctly to preserve the names of your fields. See the [Android example](examples/android-proguard-example/README.md) for more information.
+
+If you want to preserve backward compatibility for you app you can use [`@SerializedName`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/annotations/SerializedName.html) on the fields to specify the obfuscated name as alternate, for example: `@SerializedName(value = "myprop", alternate = "a")`
+
+Normally ProGuard and R8 produce a mapping file, this makes it easier to find out the obfuscated field names instead of having to find them out through trial and error or other means. See the [Android Studio user guide](https://developer.android.com/studio/build/shrink-code.html#retracing) for more information.
+
+## <a id="default-field-values-missing"></a> Default field values not present after deserialization
+
+**Symptom:** You have assign default values to fields but after deserialization the fields have their standard value (such as `null` or `0`)
+
+**Reason:** Gson cannot invoke the constructor of your class and falls back to JDK `Unsafe` (or similar means)
+
+**Solution:** Make sure that the class:
+
+- is `static` (explicitly or implicitly when it is a top-level class)
+- has a no-args constructor
+
+Otherwise Gson will by default try to use JDK `Unsafe` or similar means to create an instance of your class without invoking the constructor and without running any initializers. You can also disable that behavior through [`GsonBuilder.disableJdkUnsafe()`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.html#disableJdkUnsafe()) to notice such issues early on.
+
+## <a id="anonymous-local-null"></a> `null` values for anonymous and local classes
+
+**Symptom:** Objects of a class are always serialized as JSON `null` / always deserialized as Java `null`
+
+**Reason:** The class you are serializing or deserializing is an anonymous or a local class (or you have specified a custom `ExclusionStrategy`)
+
+**Solution:** Convert the class to a `static` nested class. If the class is already `static` make sure you have not specified a Gson `ExclusionStrategy` which might exclude the class.
+
+Notes:
+
+- "double brace-initialization" also creates anonymous classes
+- Local record classes (feature added in Java 16) are supported by Gson and are not affected by this
+
+## <a id="map-key-wrong-json"></a> Map keys having unexpected format in JSON
+
+**Symptom:** JSON output for `Map` keys is unexpected / cannot be deserialized again
+
+**Reason:** The `Map` key type is 'complex' and you have not configured the `GsonBuilder` properly
+
+**Solution:** Use [`GsonBuilder.enableComplexMapKeySerialization()`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.html#enableComplexMapKeySerialization()). See also the [user guide](UserGuide.md#maps-examples) for more information.
+
+## <a id="malformed-json"></a> Parsing JSON fails with `MalformedJsonException`
+
+**Symptom:** JSON parsing fails with `MalformedJsonException`
+
+**Reason:** The JSON data is actually malformed
+
+**Solution:** During debugging, log the JSON data right before calling Gson methods or set a breakpoint to inspect the data and make sure it has the expected format. Sometimes APIs might return HTML error pages (instead of JSON data) when reaching rate limits or when other errors occur. Also read the location information of the `MalformedJsonException` exception message, it indicates where exactly in the document the malformed data was detected, including the [JSONPath](https://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/).
+
+For example, let's assume you want to deserialize the following JSON data:
+
+```json
+{
+  "languages": [
+    "English",
+    "French",
+  ]
+}
+```
+
+This will fail with an exception similar to this one: `MalformedJsonException: Use JsonReader.setLenient(true) to accept malformed JSON at line 5 column 4 path $.languages[2]`  
+The problem here is the trailing comma (`,`) after `"French"`, trailing commas are not allowed by the JSON specification. The location information "line 5 column 4" points to the `]` in the JSON data (with some slight inaccuracies) because Gson expected another value after `,` instead of the closing `]`. The JSONPath `$.languages[2]` in the exception message also points there: `$.` refers to the root object, `languages` refers to its member of that name and `[2]` refers to the (missing) third value in the JSON array value of that member (numbering starts at 0, so it is `[2]` instead of `[3]`).  
+The proper solution here is to fix the malformed JSON data.
+
+To spot syntax errors in the JSON data easily you can open it in an editor with support for JSON, for example Visual Studio Code. It will highlight within the JSON data the error location and show why the JSON data is considered invalid.
+
+## <a id="number-parsed-as-double"></a> Integral JSON number is parsed as `double`
+
+**Symptom:** JSON data contains an integral number such as `45` but Gson returns it as `double`
+
+**Reason:** When parsing a JSON number as `Object`, Gson will by default create always return a `double`
+
+**Solution:** Use [`GsonBuilder.setObjectToNumberStrategy`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.html#setObjectToNumberStrategy(com.google.gson.ToNumberStrategy)) to specify what type of number should be returned
+
+## <a id="default-lenient"></a> Malformed JSON not rejected
+
+**Symptom:** Gson parses malformed JSON without throwing any exceptions
+
+**Reason:** Due to legacy reasons Gson performs parsing by default in lenient mode
+
+**Solution:** See [`Gson` class documentation](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/Gson.html#default-lenient) section "Lenient JSON handling"
+
+Note: Even in non-lenient mode Gson deviates slightly from the JSON specification, see [`JsonReader.setLenient`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/stream/JsonReader.html#setLenient(boolean)) for more details.
+
+## <a id="unexpected-json-structure"></a> `IllegalStateException`: "Expected ... but was ..."
+
+**Symptom:** An `IllegalStateException` with a message in the form "Expected ... but was ..." is thrown
+
+**Reason:** The JSON data does not have the correct format
+
+**Solution:** Make sure that your classes correctly model the JSON data. Also during debugging log the JSON data right before calling Gson methods or set a breakpoint to inspect the data and make sure it has the expected format. Read the location information of the exception message, it indicates where exactly in the document the error occurred, including the [JSONPath](https://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/).
+
+For example, let's assume you have the following Java class:
+
+```java
+class WebPage {
+    String languages;
+}
+```
+
+And you want to deserialize the following JSON data:
+
+```json
+{
+  "languages": ["English", "French"]
+}
+```
+
+This will fail with an exception similar to this one: `IllegalStateException: Expected a string but was BEGIN_ARRAY at line 2 column 17 path $.languages`  
+This means Gson expected a JSON string value but found the beginning of a JSON array (`[`). The location information "line 2 column 17" points to the `[` in the JSON data (with some slight inaccuracies), so does the JSONPath `$.languages` in the exception message. It refers to the `languages` member of the root object (`$.`).  
+The solution here is to change in the `WebPage` class the field `String languages` to `List<String> languages`.
+
+## <a id="adapter-not-null-safe"></a> `IllegalStateException`: "Expected ... but was NULL"
+
+**Symptom:** An `IllegalStateException` with a message in the form "Expected ... but was NULL" is thrown
+
+**Reason:**
+
+- A built-in adapter does not support JSON null values
+- You have written a custom `TypeAdapter` which does not properly handle JSON null values
+
+**Solution:** If this occurs for a custom adapter you wrote, add code similar to the following at the beginning of its `read` method:
+
+```java
+@Override
+public MyClass read(JsonReader in) throws IOException {
+    if (in.peek() == JsonToken.NULL) {
+        in.nextNull();
+        return null;
+    }
+
+    ...
+}
+```
+
+Alternatively you can call [`nullSafe()`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html#nullSafe()) on the adapter instance you created.
+
+## <a id="serialize-nulls"></a> Properties missing in JSON
+
+**Symptom:** Properties are missing in the JSON output
+
+**Reason:** Gson by default omits JSON null from the output (or: ProGuard / R8 is not configured correctly and removed unused fields)
+
+**Solution:** Use [`GsonBuilder.serializeNulls()`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.html#serializeNulls())
+
+Note: Gson does not support anonymous and local classes and will serialize them as JSON null, see the [related troubleshooting point](#null-values-for-anonymous-and-local-classes).
+
+## <a id="android-internal-fields"></a> JSON output changes for newer Android versions
+
+**Symptom:** The JSON output differs when running on newer Android versions
+
+**Reason:** You use Gson by accident to access internal fields of Android classes
+
+**Solution:** Write custom Gson [`TypeAdapter`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html) implementations for the affected classes or change the type of your data
+
+**Explanation:**
+
+When no built-in adapter for a type exists and no custom adapter has been registered, Gson falls back to using reflection to access the fields of a class (including `private` ones). Most likely you are experiencing this issue because you (by accident) rely on the reflection-based adapter for Android classes.

+
+## <a id="json-static-fields"></a> JSON output contains values of `static` fields
+
+**Symptom:** The JSON output contains values of `static` fields
+
+**Reason:** You used `GsonBuilder.excludeFieldsWithModifiers` to overwrite the default excluded modifiers
+
+**Solution:** When calling `GsonBuilder.excludeFieldsWithModifiers` you overwrite the default excluded modifiers. Therefore, you have to explicitly exclude `static` fields if desired. This can be done by adding `Modifier.STATIC` as additional argument.
+
+## <a id="no-such-method-error"></a> `NoSuchMethodError` when calling Gson methods
+
+**Symptom:** A `java.lang.NoSuchMethodError` is thrown when trying to call certain Gson methods
+
+**Reason:**
+
+- You have multiple versions of Gson on your classpath
+- Or, the Gson version you compiled against is different from the one on your classpath
+- Or, you are using a code shrinking tool such as ProGuard or R8 which removed methods from Gson
+
+**Solution:** First disable any code shrinking tools such as ProGuard or R8 and check if the issue persists. If not, you have to tweak the configuration of that tool to not modify Gson classes. Otherwise verify that the Gson JAR on your classpath is the same you are compiling against, and that there is only one Gson JAR on your classpath. See [this Stack Overflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/q/227486) to find out where a class is loaded from. For example, for debugging you could include the following code:
+
+```java
+System.out.println(Gson.class.getProtectionDomain().getCodeSource().getLocation());
+```
+
+If that fails with a `NullPointerException` you have to try one of the other ways to find out where a class is loaded from.
+
+## <a id="duplicate-fields"></a> `IllegalArgumentException`: 'Class ... declares multiple JSON fields named '...''
+
+**Symptom:** An exception with the message 'Class ... declares multiple JSON fields named '...'' is thrown
+
+**Reason:**
+
+- The name you have specified with a [`@SerializedName`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/annotations/SerializedName.html) annotation for a field collides with the name of another field
+- The [`FieldNamingStrategy`](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/FieldNamingStrategy.html) you have specified produces conflicting field names
+- A field of your class has the same name as the field of a superclass
+
+Gson prevents multiple fields with the same name because during deserialization it would be ambiguous for which field the JSON data should be deserialized. For serialization it would cause the same field to appear multiple times in JSON. While the JSON specification permits this, it is likely that the application parsing the JSON data will not handle it correctly.
+
+**Solution:** First identify the fields with conflicting names based on the exception message. Then decide if you want to rename one of them using the [`@SerializedName`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/annotations/SerializedName.html) annotation, or if you want to [exclude](UserGuide.md#excluding-fields-from-serialization-and-deserialization) one of them. When excluding one of the fields you have to include it for both serialization and deserialization (even if your application only performs one of these actions) because the duplicate field check cannot differentiate between these actions.
+
+## <a id="java-lang-class-unsupported"></a> `UnsupportedOperationException` when serializing or deserializing `java.lang.Class`
+
+**Symptom:** An `UnsupportedOperationException` is thrown when trying to serialize or deserialize `java.lang.Class`
+
+**Reason:** Gson intentionally does not permit serializing and deserializing `java.lang.Class` for security reasons. Otherwise a malicious user could make your application load an arbitrary class from the classpath and, depending on what your application does with the `Class`, in the worst case perform a remote code execution attack.

If the `Class` values are not known in advance, try to introduce a common base class or interface for all these classes and then verify that the deserialized class is a subclass. For example assuming the base class is called `MyBaseClass`, your custom `TypeAdapter` should load the class like this:
+
+```java
+Class.forName(jsonString, false, getClass().getClassLoader()).asSubclass(MyBaseClass.class)
+```
+
+This will not initialize arbitrary classes, and it will throw a `ClassCastException` if the loaded class is not the same as or a subclass of `MyBaseClass`.
+
+## <a id="type-token-raw"></a> `IllegalStateException`: 'TypeToken must be created with a type argument' <br> `RuntimeException`: 'Missing type parameter'
+
+**Symptom:** An `IllegalStateException` with the message 'TypeToken must be created with a type argument' is thrown.  
+For older Gson versions a `RuntimeException` with message 'Missing type parameter' is thrown.
+
+**Reason:**
+
+- You created a `TypeToken` without type argument, for example `new TypeToken() {}` (note the missing `<...>`). You always have to provide the type argument, for example like this: `new TypeToken<List<String>>() {}`. Normally the compiler will also emit a 'raw types' warning when you forget the `<...>`.
+- You are using a code shrinking tool such as ProGuard or R8 (Android app builds normally have this enabled by default) but have not configured it correctly for usage with Gson.
+
+**Solution:** When you are using a code shrinking tool such as ProGuard or R8 you have to adjust your configuration to include the following rules:
+
+```
+# Keep generic signatures; needed for correct type resolution
+-keepattributes Signature
+
+# Keep class TypeToken (respectively its generic signature)
+-keep class com.google.gson.reflect.TypeToken { *; }
+
+# Keep any (anonymous) classes extending TypeToken
+-keep class * extends com.google.gson.reflect.TypeToken
+```
+
+See also the [Android example](examples/android-proguard-example/README.md) for more information.
+
+Note: For newer Gson versions these rules might be applied automatically; make sure you are using the latest Gson version and the latest version of the code shrinking tool.
+
+## <a id="r8-abstract-class"></a> `JsonIOException`: 'Abstract classes can't be instantiated!' (R8)
+
+**Symptom:** A `JsonIOException` with the message 'Abstract classes can't be instantiated!' is thrown; the class mentioned in the exception message is not actually `abstract` in your source code, and you are using the code shrinking tool R8 (Android app builds normally have this configured by default).
+
+**Reason:** The code shrinking tool R8 performs optimizations where it may remove constructors and make a class `abstract`. Due to this Gson cannot create an instance of the class.
+
+**Solution:** Prefer keeping all constructors of the class to avoid issues where a no-args constructor does not exist (common for Kotlin classes with only a primary constructor).
+
+Example keeping all constructors of a specific class:
+
+```
+# Keep all constructors of the deserialized class
+-keep class com.example.MyClass {
+  <init>(...);
+}
+```
+
+Notes on -keep vs -keepclassmembers:
+
+- `-keep` is more robust in scenarios where a specific constructor signature does not exist; it also helps prevent R8 from turning the class into `abstract`.
+- `-keepclassmembers` only keeps the specified members; if you use `<init>();` but the class has no no-args constructor, the rule does not match and R8 optimizations may still make the class abstract.
+
+Annotation-based rules (general approach):
+
+You can configure ProGuard/R8 to keep constructors for classes that are likely used with Gson by detecting Gson annotations on fields or types. This reduces the chance that classes are turned `abstract` or have their constructors removed. For example:
+
+```
+# If a class has fields annotated with @SerializedName, keep all its constructors
+-if class * {
+  @com.google.gson.annotations.SerializedName <fields>;
+}
+-keep class <1> {
+  <init>(...);
+}
+# Also keep classes with members matching @SerializedName to avoid abstract-class transformation
+-keepclasseswithmembers class * {
+  @com.google.gson.annotations.SerializedName <fields>;
+}
+
+# Repeat similarly for other Gson annotations:
+-if class * {
+  @com.google.gson.annotations.Expose <fields>;
+}
+-keep class <1> {
+  <init>(...);
+}
+-keepclasseswithmembers class * {
+  @com.google.gson.annotations.Expose <fields>;
+}
+
+-if class * {
+  @com.google.gson.annotations.Since <fields>;
+}
+-keep class <1> {
+  <init>(...);
+}
+-keepclasseswithmembers class * {
+  @com.google.gson.annotations.Since <fields>;
+}
+
+-if class * {
+  @com.google.gson.annotations.Until <fields>;
+}
+-keep class <1> {
+  <init>(...);
+}
+-keepclasseswithmembers class * {
+  @com.google.gson.annotations.Until <fields>;
+}
+
+# For @JsonAdapter on fields
+-if class * {
+  @com.google.gson.annotations.JsonAdapter <fields>;
+}
+-keep class <1> {
+  <init>(...);
+}
+-keepclasseswithmembers class * {
+  @com.google.gson.annotations.JsonAdapter <fields>;
+}
+
+# If a class itself is annotated with @JsonAdapter, keep all its constructors
+-if @com.google.gson.annotations.JsonAdapter class *
+-keep class <1> {
+  <init>(...);
+}
+```
+
+Android-specific tip:
+
+- Instead of ProGuard/R8 configuration, you can annotate the class or constructor with `@Keep` to prevent removal or obfuscation as needed. See https://developer.android.com/studio/write/annotations#keep
+
+Kotlin note:
+
+- Many Kotlin classes do not have a no-args constructor because properties are typically declared via a primary constructor (e.g., `class MyClass(val s: String)`). Gson may use JDK Unsafe by default to instantiate such classes without calling a constructor. If you disable this behavior via `GsonBuilder.disableJdkUnsafe()`, you must provide a suitable constructor or register an `InstanceCreator`/`TypeAdapter`.
+
+If the class is truly abstract in your source code:
+
+- This exception is unrelated to R8. You will have to implement a custom [`InstanceCreator`](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/InstanceCreator.html) or [`TypeAdapter`](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html) that creates an instance of a concrete subtype.

+
+Additional tips:
+
+- Newer Gson versions include default rules to keep constructors for classes that are likely used with Gson based on annotations like `@SerializedName`, `@Expose`, `@Since`, `@Until`, and `@JsonAdapter`. This helps prevent R8 from making such classes abstract or removing their constructors.
+- If you prefer not to manage ProGuard/R8 rules per class, consider using Android's `@Keep` annotation on the class or constructor. See https://developer.android.com/studio/write/annotations#keep
+- These defaults do not prevent obfuscation of field names. If you need stable JSON property names across releases, use `@SerializedName` with explicit names or add additional rules to preserve field names as needed.

Considerations:\n- Identify potential impacts on existing functionality\n- Consider backward compatibility\n- Note any dependencies or prerequisites\n\nDo NOT provide actual code snippets or diffs. Focus on describing what needs to be implemented.\n\nHere are the details for analysis:\n\nIssue title:\nImprove default ProGuard / R8 rules and Troubleshooting Guide\n\nIssue description: \n# Problem solved by the feature\nImprove the default ProGuard / R8 rules in `META-INF/proguard/gson.pro` added by #2397, and the Troubleshooting Guide.\n\n# Feature description\nI was testing the new default rules with an Android app and Kotlin classes, and there might be the following areas to improve.\n\n### Troubleshooting Guide: `JsonIOException`: \'Abstract classes can\'t be instantiated!\' (R8)\n\nThe Troubleshooting Guide currently suggests the following:\n```\n# Keep the no-args constructor of the deserialized class\n-keepclassmembers class com.example.MyClass {\n  <init>();\n}\n```\n\nThis means only the no-args constructor is kept, but not any other constructors. However, especially for Kotlin I assume it is common that classes don\'t have a no-args constructor because you might declare properties and the primary constructor at once, e.g. `class MyClass(val s: String)` (see [Kotlin documentation](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/classes.html#constructors)). Not sure though if using that is a good idea in combination with Gson because it then requires JDK Unsafe to create instances, but that is a different topic.\n\nSo there are two questions:\n- Should the Troubleshooting Guide rather recommend `<init>(...);` (all constructors), so that the users don\'t experience issues with R8 anymore (but implicitly depend on JDK Unsafe; using `GsonBuilder.disableJdkUnsafe()` would cause Gson to fail with a different exception)\n- Should the Troubleshooting Guide recommend `-keep` instead of `-keepclassmembers`. In case the `<init>` rule for the class properly matches a constructor it might not matter. But in case `<init>();` is used, but a no-args constructor does not exist, then `-keep` seems to at least have the side-effect that R8 does not make the class abstract (and then using JDK Unsafe an instance can be created).\n\n### Troubleshooting Guide: Recommend `@Keep` for Android\nInstead of configuring ProGuard / R8 rules, it might be easier for Android developers to use `@Keep` on the corresponding class or constructor, see https://developer.android.com/studio/write/annotations#keep\n\n### Preventing R8 from making classes abstract / removing no-args constructor\n\nIt would be good if we could adjust the default rules to avoid the "Abstract classes can\'t be instantiated!" exception (for most cases) in the first place.\n\nThere is probably no general way to detect if a class might be used with Gson, but the most reliable variant might be to keep the constructor if any of the Gson annotations is used by a class.\n\nThis can probably be achieved with an [`-if` rule](https://www.guardsquare.com/manual/configuration/usage#if) (see also [answers to this Stack Overflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/q/63162818)). For example:\n```\n# If class has fields with `@SerializedName` annotation keep its constructors\n-if class * {\n  @com.google.gson.annotations.SerializedName <fields>;\n}\n-keep class <1> {\n  <init>(...);\n}\n```\n(duplicated for all Gson annotations)\n\nBut it looks like this is not enough, maybe because there is no `-keep` (or `-keepclasseswithmembers`) rule for the class in the first place so `-if` somehow has no effect? You additionally need the following (duplicated for all Gson annotations probably):\n```\n-keepclasseswithmembers class * {\n  @com.google.gson.annotations.SerializedName <fields>;\n}\n```\nOnly then the class is not made abstract and the constructor is properly kept...\n\n(As side note: Having only the `-keepclasseswithmembers ... { @SerializedName }` above, but not the `-if ... -keep` seems to prevent R8 from making the class abstract, but still removes all constructors, so users would be dependent on JDK Unsafe then.)\n\nOr similar to https://github.com/google/gson/issues/2379#issuecomment-1564517629 maybe the following would work as well:\n```\n-keepclasseswithmembers class * {\n  <init>(...);\n  @com.google.gson.annotations.SerializedName <fields>;\n}\n```\nThere is however probably no need for the `-if` rule shown in the original comment, unless that has some special effect, see https://github.com/google/gson/pull/2397#issuecomment-1575236086.\n\n### R8 makes class abstract but still keeps constructors\n\nIt also looks like the Android app build creates (for some reason) additional constructors / keeps constructors even when the class is made abstract. Due to this, the Troubleshooting Guide URLs are unfortunately not included in the exception messages (they are only added at the moment when there are no constructors).\nNot really sure why these constructors exist in the first place and are kept even when the class is made abstract. In the R8 integration test of Gson this behavior was not seen.\n\nMaybe we should remove the `getDeclaredConstructors().length == 0` check if the class is abstract and always refer to the Troubleshooting Guide. The guide would have to be adjusted then though to also properly cover the case where the class was indeed abstract in the source code.\n\n---\n\nAny additional feedback is highly appreciated!\n\n\nIssue comments:\n\n\nFeature Context:\nFile: Troubleshooting.md\nLine number range: 1 - 329\nContent:\n1. # Troubleshooting Guide\n2. \n3. This guide describes how to troubleshoot common issues when using Gson.\n4. \n5. <!-- The \'<a id="..."></a>\' anchors below are used to create stable links; don\'t remove or rename them -->\n6. <!-- Use only lowercase IDs, GitHub seems to not support uppercase IDs, see also https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/50962 -->\n7. \n8. ## <a id="class-cast-exception"></a> `ClassCastException` when using deserialized object\n9. \n10. **Symptom:** `ClassCastException` is thrown when accessing an object deserialized by Gson\n11. \n12. **Reason:** Your code is most likely not type-safe\n13. \n14. **Solution:** Make sure your code adheres to the following:\n15. \n16. - Avoid raw types: Instead of calling `fromJson(..., List.class)`, create for example a `TypeToken<List<MyClass>>`.\n17.   See the [user guide](UserGuide.md#collections-examples) for more information.\n18. - When using `TypeToken` prefer the `Gson.fromJson` overloads with `TypeToken` parameter such as [`fromJson(Reader, TypeToken)`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/Gson.html#fromJson(java.io.Reader,com.google.gson.reflect.TypeToken)).\n19.   The overloads with `Type` parameter do not provide any type-safety guarantees.\n20. - When using `TypeToken` make sure you don\'t capture a type variable. For example avoid something like `new TypeToken<List<T>>()` (where `T` is a type variable). Due to Java type erasure the actual type of `T` is not available at runtime. Refactor your code to pass around `TypeToken` instances or use [`TypeToken.getParameterized(...)`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/reflect/TypeToken.html#getParameterized(java.lang.reflect.Type,java.lang.reflect.Type...)), for example `TypeToken.getParameterized(List.class, elementClass)`.\n21. \n22. ## <a id="reflection-inaccessible"></a> `InaccessibleObjectException`: \'module ... does not "opens ..." to unnamed module\'\n23. \n24. **Symptom:** An exception with a message in the form \'module ... does not "opens ..." to unnamed module\' is thrown\n25. \n26. **Reason:** You use Gson by accident to access internal fields of third-party classes\n27. \n28. **Solution:** Write custom Gson [`TypeAdapter`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html) implementations for the affected classes or change the type of your data. If this occurs for a field in one of your classes which you did not actually want to serialize or deserialize in the first place, you can exclude that field, see the [user guide](UserGuide.md#excluding-fields-from-serialization-and-deserialization).\n29. \n30. **Explanation:**\n31. \n32. When no built-in adapter for a type exists and no custom adapter has been registered, Gson falls back to using reflection to access the fields of a class (including `private` ones). Most likely you are seeing this error because you (by accident) rely on the reflection-based adapter for third-party classes. That should be avoided because you make yourself dependent on the implementation details of these classes which could change at any point. For the JDK it is also not possible anymore to access internal fields using reflection starting with JDK 17, see [JEP 403](https://openjdk.org/jeps/403).\n33. \n34. If you want to prevent using reflection on third-party classes in the future you can write your own [`ReflectionAccessFilter`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/ReflectionAccessFilter.html) or use one of the predefined ones, such as `ReflectionAccessFilter.BLOCK_ALL_PLATFORM`.\n35. \n36. ## <a id="reflection-inaccessible-to-module-gson"></a> `InaccessibleObjectException`: \'module ... does not "opens ..." to module com.google.gson\'\n37. \n38. **Symptom:** An exception with a message in the form \'module ... does not "opens ..." to module com.google.gson\' is thrown\n39. \n40. **Reason:**\n41. \n42. - If the reported package is your own package then you have not configured the module declaration of your project to allow Gson to use reflection on your classes.\n43. - If the reported package is from a third party library or the JDK see [this troubleshooting point](#inaccessibleobjectexception-module--does-not-opens--to-unnamed-module).\n44. \n45. **Solution:** Make sure the `module-info.java` file of your project allows Gson to use reflection on your classes, for example:\n46. \n47. ```java\n48. module mymodule {\n49.     requires com.google.gson;\n50. \n51.     opens mypackage to com.google.gson;\n52. }\n53. ```\n54. \n55. Or in case this occurs for a field in one of your classes which you did not actually want to serialize or deserialize in the first place, you can exclude that field, see the [user guide](UserGuide.md#excluding-fields-from-serialization-and-deserialization).\n56. \n57. ## <a id="android-app-random-names"></a> Android app not working in Release mode; random property names\n58. \n59. **Symptom:** Your Android app is working fine in Debug mode but fails in Release mode and the JSON properties have seemingly random names such as `a`, `b`, ...\n60. \n61. **Reason:** You probably have not configured ProGuard / R8 correctly\n62. \n63. **Solution:** Make sure you have configured ProGuard / R8 correctly to preserve the names of your fields. See the [Android example](examples/android-proguard-example/README.md) for more information.\n64. \n65. ## <a id="android-app-broken-after-app-update"></a> Android app unable to parse JSON after app update\n66. \n67. **Symptom:** You released a new version of your Android app and it fails to parse JSON data created by the previous version of your app\n68. \n69. **Reason:** You probably have not configured ProGuard / R8 correctly; probably the fields names are being obfuscated and their naming changed between the versions of your app\n70. \n71. **Solution:** Make sure you have configured ProGuard / R8 correctly to preserve the names of your fields. See the [Android example](examples/android-proguard-example/README.md) for more information.\n72. \n73. If you want to preserve backward compatibility for you app you can use [`@SerializedName`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/annotations/SerializedName.html) on the fields to specify the obfuscated name as alternate, for example: `@SerializedName(value = "myprop", alternate = "a")`\n74. \n75. Normally ProGuard and R8 produce a mapping file, this makes it easier to find out the obfuscated field names instead of having to find them out through trial and error or other means. See the [Android Studio user guide](https://developer.android.com/studio/build/shrink-code.html#retracing) for more information.\n76. \n77. ## <a id="default-field-values-missing"></a> Default field values not present after deserialization\n78. \n79. **Symptom:** You have assign default values to fields but after deserialization the fields have their standard value (such as `null` or `0`)\n80. \n81. **Reason:** Gson cannot invoke the constructor of your class and falls back to JDK `Unsafe` (or similar means)\n82. \n83. **Solution:** Make sure that the class:\n84. \n85. - is `static` (explicitly or implicitly when it is a top-level class)\n86. - has a no-args constructor\n87. \n88. Otherwise Gson will by default try to use JDK `Unsafe` or similar means to create an instance of your class without invoking the constructor and without running any initializers. You can also disable that behavior through [`GsonBuilder.disableJdkUnsafe()`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.html#disableJdkUnsafe()) to notice such issues early on.\n89. \n90. ## <a id="anonymous-local-null"></a> `null` values for anonymous and local classes\n91. \n92. **Symptom:** Objects of a class are always serialized as JSON `null` / always deserialized as Java `null`\n93. \n94. **Reason:** The class you are serializing or deserializing is an anonymous or a local class (or you have specified a custom `ExclusionStrategy`)\n95. \n96. **Solution:** Convert the class to a `static` nested class. If the class is already `static` make sure you have not specified a Gson `ExclusionStrategy` which might exclude the class.\n97. \n98. Notes:\n99. \n100. - "double brace-initialization" also creates anonymous classes\n101. - Local record classes (feature added in Java 16) are supported by Gson and are not affected by this\n102. \n103. ## <a id="map-key-wrong-json"></a> Map keys having unexpected format in JSON\n104. \n105. **Symptom:** JSON output for `Map` keys is unexpected / cannot be deserialized again\n106. \n107. **Reason:** The `Map` key type is \'complex\' and you have not configured the `GsonBuilder` properly\n108. \n109. **Solution:** Use [`GsonBuilder.enableComplexMapKeySerialization()`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.html#enableComplexMapKeySerialization()). See also the [user guide](UserGuide.md#maps-examples) for more information.\n110. \n111. ## <a id="malformed-json"></a> Parsing JSON fails with `MalformedJsonException`\n112. \n113. **Symptom:** JSON parsing fails with `MalformedJsonException`\n114. \n115. **Reason:** The JSON data is actually malformed\n116. \n117. **Solution:** During debugging, log the JSON data right before calling Gson methods or set a breakpoint to inspect the data and make sure it has the expected format. Sometimes APIs might return HTML error pages (instead of JSON data) when reaching rate limits or when other errors occur. Also read the location information of the `MalformedJsonException` exception message, it indicates where exactly in the document the malformed data was detected, including the [JSONPath](https://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/).\n118. \n119. For example, let\'s assume you want to deserialize the following JSON data:\n120. \n121. ```json\n122. {\n123.   "languages": [\n124.     "English",\n125.     "French",\n126.   ]\n127. }\n128. ```\n129. \n130. This will fail with an exception similar to this one: `MalformedJsonException: Use JsonReader.setLenient(true) to accept malformed JSON at line 5 column 4 path $.languages[2]`  \n131. The problem here is the trailing comma (`,`) after `"French"`, trailing commas are not allowed by the JSON specification. The location information "line 5 column 4" points to the `]` in the JSON data (with some slight inaccuracies) because Gson expected another value after `,` instead of the closing `]`. The JSONPath `$.languages[2]` in the exception message also points there: `$.` refers to the root object, `languages` refers to its member of that name and `[2]` refers to the (missing) third value in the JSON array value of that member (numbering starts at 0, so it is `[2]` instead of `[3]`).  \n132. The proper solution here is to fix the malformed JSON data.\n133. \n134. To spot syntax errors in the JSON data easily you can open it in an editor with support for JSON, for example Visual Studio Code. It will highlight within the JSON data the error location and show why the JSON data is considered invalid.\n135. \n136. ## <a id="number-parsed-as-double"></a> Integral JSON number is parsed as `double`\n137. \n138. **Symptom:** JSON data contains an integral number such as `45` but Gson returns it as `double`\n139. \n140. **Reason:** When parsing a JSON number as `Object`, Gson will by default create always return a `double`\n141. \n142. **Solution:** Use [`GsonBuilder.setObjectToNumberStrategy`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.html#setObjectToNumberStrategy(com.google.gson.ToNumberStrategy)) to specify what type of number should be returned\n143. \n144. ## <a id="default-lenient"></a> Malformed JSON not rejected\n145. \n146. **Symptom:** Gson parses malformed JSON without throwing any exceptions\n147. \n148. **Reason:** Due to legacy reasons Gson performs parsing by default in lenient mode\n149. \n150. **Solution:** See [`Gson` class documentation](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/Gson.html#default-lenient) section "Lenient JSON handling"\n151. \n152. Note: Even in non-lenient mode Gson deviates slightly from the JSON specification, see [`JsonReader.setLenient`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/stream/JsonReader.html#setLenient(boolean)) for more details.\n153. \n154. ## <a id="unexpected-json-structure"></a> `IllegalStateException`: "Expected ... but was ..."\n155. \n156. **Symptom:** An `IllegalStateException` with a message in the form "Expected ... but was ..." is thrown\n157. \n158. **Reason:** The JSON data does not have the correct format\n159. \n160. **Solution:** Make sure that your classes correctly model the JSON data. Also during debugging log the JSON data right before calling Gson methods or set a breakpoint to inspect the data and make sure it has the expected format. Read the location information of the exception message, it indicates where exactly in the document the error occurred, including the [JSONPath](https://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/).\n161. \n162. For example, let\'s assume you have the following Java class:\n163. \n164. ```java\n165. class WebPage {\n166.     String languages;\n167. }\n168. ```\n169. \n170. And you want to deserialize the following JSON data:\n171. \n172. ```json\n173. {\n174.   "languages": ["English", "French"]\n175. }\n176. ```\n177. \n178. This will fail with an exception similar to this one: `IllegalStateException: Expected a string but was BEGIN_ARRAY at line 2 column 17 path $.languages`  \n179. This means Gson expected a JSON string value but found the beginning of a JSON array (`[`). The location information "line 2 column 17" points to the `[` in the JSON data (with some slight inaccuracies), so does the JSONPath `$.languages` in the exception message. It refers to the `languages` member of the root object (`$.`).  \n180. The solution here is to change in the `WebPage` class the field `String languages` to `List<String> languages`.\n181. \n182. ## <a id="adapter-not-null-safe"></a> `IllegalStateException`: "Expected ... but was NULL"\n183. \n184. **Symptom:** An `IllegalStateException` with a message in the form "Expected ... but was NULL" is thrown\n185. \n186. **Reason:**\n187. \n188. - A built-in adapter does not support JSON null values\n189. - You have written a custom `TypeAdapter` which does not properly handle JSON null values\n190. \n191. **Solution:** If this occurs for a custom adapter you wrote, add code similar to the following at the beginning of its `read` method:\n192. \n193. ```java\n194. @Override\n195. public MyClass read(JsonReader in) throws IOException {\n196.     if (in.peek() == JsonToken.NULL) {\n197.         in.nextNull();\n198.         return null;\n199.     }\n200. \n201.     ...\n202. }\n203. ```\n204. \n205. Alternatively you can call [`nullSafe()`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html#nullSafe()) on the adapter instance you created.\n206. \n207. ## <a id="serialize-nulls"></a> Properties missing in JSON\n208. \n209. **Symptom:** Properties are missing in the JSON output\n210. \n211. **Reason:** Gson by default omits JSON null from the output (or: ProGuard / R8 is not configured correctly and removed unused fields)\n212. \n213. **Solution:** Use [`GsonBuilder.serializeNulls()`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.html#serializeNulls())\n214. \n215. Note: Gson does not support anonymous and local classes and will serialize them as JSON null, see the [related troubleshooting point](#null-values-for-anonymous-and-local-classes).\n216. \n217. ## <a id="android-internal-fields"></a> JSON output changes for newer Android versions\n218. \n219. **Symptom:** The JSON output differs when running on newer Android versions\n220. \n221. **Reason:** You use Gson by accident to access internal fields of Android classes\n222. \n223. **Solution:** Write custom Gson [`TypeAdapter`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html) implementations for the affected classes or change the type of your data\n224. \n225. **Explanation:**\n226. \n227. When no built-in adapter for a type exists and no custom adapter has been registered, Gson falls back to using reflection to access the fields of a class (including `private` ones). Most likely you are experiencing this issue because you (by accident) rely on the reflection-based adapter for Android classes. That should be avoided because you make yourself dependent on the implementation details of these classes which could change at any point.\n228. \n229. If you want to prevent using reflection on third-party classes in the future you can write your own [`ReflectionAccessFilter`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/ReflectionAccessFilter.html) or use one of the predefined ones, such as `ReflectionAccessFilter.BLOCK_ALL_PLATFORM`.\n230. \n231. ## <a id="json-static-fields"></a> JSON output contains values of `static` fields\n232. \n233. **Symptom:** The JSON output contains values of `static` fields\n234. \n235. **Reason:** You used `GsonBuilder.excludeFieldsWithModifiers` to overwrite the default excluded modifiers\n236. \n237. **Solution:** When calling `GsonBuilder.excludeFieldsWithModifiers` you overwrite the default excluded modifiers. Therefore, you have to explicitly exclude `static` fields if desired. This can be done by adding `Modifier.STATIC` as additional argument.\n238. \n239. ## <a id="no-such-method-error"></a> `NoSuchMethodError` when calling Gson methods\n240. \n241. **Symptom:** A `java.lang.NoSuchMethodError` is thrown when trying to call certain Gson methods\n242. \n243. **Reason:**\n244. \n245. - You have multiple versions of Gson on your classpath\n246. - Or, the Gson version you compiled against is different from the one on your classpath\n247. - Or, you are using a code shrinking tool such as ProGuard or R8 which removed methods from Gson\n248. \n249. **Solution:** First disable any code shrinking tools such as ProGuard or R8 and check if the issue persists. If not, you have to tweak the configuration of that tool to not modify Gson classes. Otherwise verify that the Gson JAR on your classpath is the same you are compiling against, and that there is only one Gson JAR on your classpath. See [this Stack Overflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/q/227486) to find out where a class is loaded from. For example, for debugging you could include the following code:\n250. \n251. ```java\n252. System.out.println(Gson.class.getProtectionDomain().getCodeSource().getLocation());\n253. ```\n254. \n255. If that fails with a `NullPointerException` you have to try one of the other ways to find out where a class is loaded from.\n256. \n257. ## <a id="duplicate-fields"></a> `IllegalArgumentException`: \'Class ... declares multiple JSON fields named \'...\'\'\n258. \n259. **Symptom:** An exception with the message \'Class ... declares multiple JSON fields named \'...\'\' is thrown\n260. \n261. **Reason:**\n262. \n263. - The name you have specified with a [`@SerializedName`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/annotations/SerializedName.html) annotation for a field collides with the name of another field\n264. - The [`FieldNamingStrategy`](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/FieldNamingStrategy.html) you have specified produces conflicting field names\n265. - A field of your class has the same name as the field of a superclass\n266. \n267. Gson prevents multiple fields with the same name because during deserialization it would be ambiguous for which field the JSON data should be deserialized. For serialization it would cause the same field to appear multiple times in JSON. While the JSON specification permits this, it is likely that the application parsing the JSON data will not handle it correctly.\n268. \n269. **Solution:** First identify the fields with conflicting names based on the exception message. Then decide if you want to rename one of them using the [`@SerializedName`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/annotations/SerializedName.html) annotation, or if you want to [exclude](UserGuide.md#excluding-fields-from-serialization-and-deserialization) one of them. When excluding one of the fields you have to include it for both serialization and deserialization (even if your application only performs one of these actions) because the duplicate field check cannot differentiate between these actions.\n270. \n271. ## <a id="java-lang-class-unsupported"></a> `UnsupportedOperationException` when serializing or deserializing `java.lang.Class`\n272. \n273. **Symptom:** An `UnsupportedOperationException` is thrown when trying to serialize or deserialize `java.lang.Class`\n274. \n275. **Reason:** Gson intentionally does not permit serializing and deserializing `java.lang.Class` for security reasons. Otherwise a malicious user could make your application load an arbitrary class from the classpath and, depending on what your application does with the `Class`, in the worst case perform a remote code execution attack.\n276. \n277. **Solution:** First check if you really need to serialize or deserialize a `Class`. Often it is possible to use string aliases and then map them to the known `Class`; you could write a custom [`TypeAdapter`](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html) to do this. If the `Class` values are not known in advance, try to introduce a common base class or interface for all these classes and then verify that the deserialized class is a subclass. For example assuming the base class is called `MyBaseClass`, your custom `TypeAdapter` should load the class like this:\n278. \n279. ```java\n280. Class.forName(jsonString, false, getClass().getClassLoader()).asSubclass(MyBaseClass.class)\n281. ```\n282. \n283. This will not initialize arbitrary classes, and it will throw a `ClassCastException` if the loaded class is not the same as or a subclass of `MyBaseClass`.\n284. \n285. ## <a id="type-token-raw"></a> `IllegalStateException`: \'TypeToken must be created with a type argument\' <br> `RuntimeException`: \'Missing type parameter\'\n286. \n287. **Symptom:** An `IllegalStateException` with the message \'TypeToken must be created with a type argument\' is thrown.  \n288. For older Gson versions a `RuntimeException` with message \'Missing type parameter\' is thrown.\n289. \n290. **Reason:**\n291. \n292. - You created a `TypeToken` without type argument, for example `new TypeToken() {}` (note the missing `<...>`). You always have to provide the type argument, for example like this: `new TypeToken<List<String>>() {}`. Normally the compiler will also emit a \'raw types\' warning when you forget the `<...>`.\n293. - You are using a code shrinking tool such as ProGuard or R8 (Android app builds normally have this enabled by default) but have not configured it correctly for usage with Gson.\n294. \n295. **Solution:** When you are using a code shrinking tool such as ProGuard or R8 you have to adjust your configuration to include the following rules:\n296. \n297. ```\n298. # Keep generic signatures; needed for correct type resolution\n299. -keepattributes Signature\n300. \n301. # Keep class TypeToken (respectively its generic signature)\n302. -keep class com.google.gson.reflect.TypeToken { *; }\n303. \n304. # Keep any (anonymous) classes extending TypeToken\n305. -keep class * extends com.google.gson.reflect.TypeToken\n306. ```\n307. \n308. See also the [Android example](examples/android-proguard-example/README.md) for more information.\n309. \n310. Note: For newer Gson versions these rules might be applied automatically; make sure you are using the latest Gson version and the latest version of the code shrinking tool.\n311. \n312. ## <a id="r8-abstract-class"></a> `JsonIOException`: \'Abstract classes can\'t be instantiated!\' (R8)\n313. \n314. **Symptom:** A `JsonIOException` with the message \'Abstract classes can\'t be instantiated!\' is thrown; the class mentioned in the exception message is not actually `abstract` in your source code, and you are using the code shrinking tool R8 (Android app builds normally have this configured by default).\n315. \n316. **Reason:** The code shrinking tool R8 performs optimizations where it removes the no-args constructor from a class and makes the class `abstract`. Due to this Gson cannot create an instance of the class.\n317. \n318. **Solution:** Make sure the class has a no-args constructor, then adjust your R8 configuration file to keep the constructor of the class. For example:\n319. \n320. ```\n321. # Keep the no-args constructor of the deserialized class\n322. -keepclassmembers class com.example.MyClass {\n323.   <init>();\n324. }\n325. ```\n326. \n327. For Android you can add this rule to the `proguard-rules.pro` file, see also the [Android documentation](https://developer.android.com/build/shrink-code#keep-code). In case the class name in the exception message is obfuscated, see the Android documentation about [retracing](https://developer.android.com/build/shrink-code#retracing).\n328. \n329. Note: If the class which you are trying to deserialize is actually abstract, then this exception is probably unrelated to R8 and you will have to implement a custom [`InstanceCreator`](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/InstanceCreator.html) or [`TypeAdapter`](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html) which creates an instance of a non-abstract subclass of the class.\n\n\nFile: examples/android-proguard-example/README.md\nLine number range: 1 - 17\nContent:\n1. # android-proguard-example\n2. \n3. Example Android project showing how to properly configure [ProGuard](https://www.guardsquare.com/proguard).\n4. ProGuard is a tool for \'shrinking\' and obfuscating compiled classes. It can rename methods and fields,\n5. or remove them if they appear to be unused. This can cause issues for Gson which uses Java reflection to\n6. access the fields of a class. It is necessary to configure ProGuard to make sure that Gson works correctly.\n7. \n8. Also have a look at the [ProGuard manual](https://www.guardsquare.com/manual/configuration/usage#keepoverview)\n9. and the [ProGuard Gson examples](https://www.guardsquare.com/manual/configuration/examples#gson) for more\n10. details on how ProGuard can be configured.\n11. \n12. The R8 code shrinker uses the same rule format as ProGuard, but there are differences between these two\n13. tools. Have a look at R8\'s Compatibility FAQ, and especially at the [Gson section](https://r8.googlesource.com/r8/+/refs/heads/main/compatibility-faq.md#gson).\n14. \n15. Note that newer Gson versions apply some of the rules shown in `proguard.cfg` automatically by default,\n16. see the file [`gson/META-INF/proguard/gson.pro`](/gson/src/main/resources/META-INF/proguard/gson.pro) for\n17. the Gson version you are using.\n\n\nFile: gson/src/main/java/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.java\nLine number range: 103 - 106\nContent:\n103.   private boolean generateNonExecutableJson = DEFAULT_JSON_NON_EXECUTABLE;\n104.   private boolean lenient = DEFAULT_LENIENT;\n105.   private boolean useJdkUnsafe = DEFAULT_USE_JDK_UNSAFE;\n106.   private ToNumberStrategy objectToNumberStrategy = DEFAULT_OBJECT_TO_NUMBER_STRATEGY;\n\n\nFile: gson/src/main/java/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.java\nLine number range: 756 - 760\nContent:\n756.   @CanIgnoreReturnValue\n757.   public GsonBuilder disableJdkUnsafe() {\n758.     this.useJdkUnsafe = false;\n759.     return this;\n760.   }\n\n\nFile: gson/src/main/java/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.java\nLine number range: 806 - 813\nContent:\n806.     return new Gson(excluder, fieldNamingPolicy, new HashMap<>(instanceCreators),\n807.         serializeNulls, complexMapKeySerialization,\n808.         generateNonExecutableJson, escapeHtmlChars, formattingStyle, lenient,\n809.         serializeSpecialFloatingPointValues, useJdkUnsafe, longSerializationPolicy,\n810.         datePattern, dateStyle, timeStyle, new ArrayList<>(this.factories),\n811.         new ArrayList<>(this.hierarchyFactories), factories,\n812.         objectToNumberStrategy, numberToNumberStrategy, new ArrayList<>(reflectionFilters));\n813.   }\n\n\nFile: gson/src/main/java/com/google/gson/JsonIOException.java\nLine number range: 16 - 45\nContent:\n16. package com.google.gson;\n17. \n18. /**\n19.  * This exception is raised when Gson was unable to read an input stream\n20.  * or write to one.\n21.  * \n22.  * @author Inderjeet Singh\n23.  * @author Joel Leitch\n24.  */\n25. public final class JsonIOException extends JsonParseException {\n26.   private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;\n27. \n28.   public JsonIOException(String msg) {\n29.     super(msg);\n30.   }\n31. \n32.   public JsonIOException(String msg, Throwable cause) {\n33.     super(msg, cause);\n34.   }\n35. \n36.   /**\n37.    * Creates exception with the specified cause.

2025-11-09 02:48:51,950 - thread-140613253072576.prometheus.lang_graph.nodes.issue_feature_analyzer_node - DEBUG - content="Below is a high-level analysis and implementation plan to improve the default ProGuard/R8 rules and the Troubleshooting Guide as requested.\n\n1) Feature Understanding\n\n- Goal\n  - Reduce/avoid R8-induced “Abstract classes can't be instantiated!” failures for Gson users by improving the default ProGuard/R8 rules shipped with Gson (META-INF/proguard/gson.pro).\n  - Improve the Troubleshooting Guide to provide correct and practical guidance for Java and Kotlin users (especially Android), including the recommendation to use @Keep and to keep all constructors, not just the no-args constructor.\n  - Ensure the exception messaging points users to the Troubleshooting Guide even when R8 makes a class abstract but does not remove all constructors.\n\n- Desired functionality and requirements\n  - Default shrinker rules should:\n    - Prevent R8 from making classes abstract or stripping constructors when a class is likely used with Gson.\n    - Achieve this without over-keeping too many classes (limit to classes using Gson annotations).\n  - Troubleshooting Guide should:\n    - Recommend keeping all constructors (<init>(...)) rather than only the no-args constructor.\n    - Explain implications for Kotlin classes that have no no-args constructor and how this interacts with Unsafe and GsonBuilder.disableJdkUnsafe().\n    - Prefer -keep over -keepclassmembers where it helps avoid unwanted abstracting, and suggest Android’s @Keep annotation as a simpler alternative.\n    - Cover the “class is truly abstract” scenario as a legitimate case with guidance (use InstanceCreator or TypeAdapter).\n  - Exception messages:\n    - Always link to the Troubleshooting Guide for the abstract class error, even if R8 kept some constructors.\n\n- Ambiguities and edge cases to clarify\n  - Which exact rule mechanism to use (-if + -keep vs -keepclasseswithmembers that matches both annotations and constructors): The issue indicates some combinations are required for best results across R8 behaviors. We should adopt a robust combination to maximize effectiveness while minimizing over-keeping.\n  - Which annotations to consider: At minimum @SerializedName and @JsonAdapter. To be safe and consistent, also consider @Expose, @Since, and @Until, because their presence strongly implies Gson usage.\n  - Unsafe disabled case: If GsonBuilder.disableJdkUnsafe() is used and the class has no no-args constructor, keeping constructors or avoiding abstract class might still not allow Gson to instantiate the class. The guide needs to warn and suggest alternatives.\n\n2) Architecture Analysis\n\n- Files/modules to modify\n  - gson/src/main/resources/META-INF/proguard/gson.pro\n    - Add rules to preserve constructors and avoid class abstracting for classes clearly used with Gson (detected via Gson annotations).\n  - Troubleshooting.md\n    - Update the R8 abstract class section to recommend keeping all constructors and/or using -keep, and document @Keep. Clarify Kotlin behavior and Unsafe implications.\n  - examples/android-proguard-example/README.md\n    - Mention the availability of default library rules, @Keep recommendation for Android, and the updated guidance.\n  - gson/src/main/java/com/google/gson/internal/ConstructorConstructor.java\n    - Adjust checkInstantiable(Class<?>) to always append the Troubleshooting Guide link for abstract class cases (regardless of whether constructors exist), so users get actionable guidance consistently.\n\n- Integration with existing code\n  - The default shrinker rules supplied in META-INF/proguard/gson.pro are already consumed by R8 (Android) and by ProGuard where applicable. Enhancing them improves behavior automatically for consumers.\n  - Exception message changes in ConstructorConstructor integrate with existing error/reporting paths; no changes needed elsewhere.\n  - Documentation updates integrate with existing anchors and links (TroubleshootingGuide.createUrl already constructs the anchor link).\n\n- Architectural constraints and conventions\n  - gson.pro must remain conservative to avoid excessive code retention for consumers.\n  - Troubleshooting.md must keep stable anchor IDs to avoid breaking links in error messages (keep id “r8-abstract-class”).\n  - Exception messaging should remain informative and succinct; adding a link is compatible with current style.\n\n3) Implementation Plan\n\nA) Improve default ProGuard/R8 rules\n\n- File to modify\n  - gson/src/main/resources/META-INF/proguard/gson.pro\n\n- Changes\n  - Add rules that:\n    - Detect classes that likely participate in Gson serialization/deserialization by presence of Gson annotations and keep their constructors to prevent R8 from removing constructors and/or making classes abstract.\n    - Use a combination that is effective with R8:\n      - A keep-classes-with-members rule that matches a constructor (<init>(...)) and a Gson annotation on the class or one of its fields, so the class and its constructors are kept together.\n      - Optionally augment with an -if/-keep pair per annotation to ensure the constructor retention is applied and that the class is not abstracted when the annotation is present. This dual approach mirrors the issue analysis that -if alone wasn’t sufficient and that -keepclasseswithmembers helped avoid abstracting but did not always keep constructors unless the constructor was explicitly part of the rule match.\n  - Annotations to cover:\n    - com.google.gson.annotations.SerializedName (fields; optionally consider methods only if you choose to support that pattern—note ReflectiveTypeAdapterFactory rejects certain method usages of @SerializedName, so keep focus on fields).\n    - com.google.gson.annotations.JsonAdapter (on types and fields).\n    - com.google.gson.annotations.Expose (fields).\n    - com.google.gson.annotations.Since (type and fields).\n    - com.google.gson.annotations.Until (type and fields).\n  - Rationale\n    - These annotations strongly indicate Gson is used for the class. Keeping constructors and preventing class abstraction avoids the “Abstract classes can’t be instantiated!” and constructor removal pitfalls in most practical cases, including Kotlin primary constructor-only classes.\n    - The approach strikes a balance between safety and minimal code size impact: only classes using Gson annotations are targeted.\n\nB) Update Troubleshooting Guide\n\n- File to modify\n  - Troubleshooting.md\n\n- Sections to change\n  - Section with id “r8-abstract-class” (current lines ~312–329).\n    - Replace the current recommendation (keeping only the no-args constructor) with:\n      - Primary recommendation to keep the class and all its constructors (<init>(...)) to prevent R8 from making the class abstract and to preserve constructors.\n      - Clarify that for Kotlin classes which often do not have a no-args constructor, keeping all constructors can avoid R8 abstracting but Gson may still rely on JDK Unsafe for instantiation by default. If Unsafe is disabled via GsonBuilder.disableJdkUnsafe(), deserialization will fail for classes without a usable no-args constructor unless an InstanceCreator or a TypeAdapter is provided.\n      - Recommend using -keep (class) over -keepclassmembers where appropriate, because -keep has the beneficial side effect of preventing class abstraction when a constructor signature match would otherwise fail (e.g., when a no-args constructor does not exist).\n      - Recommend using Android’s @Keep annotation on the class or specific constructor as an easier alternative to writing shrinker rules, and link to Android’s @Keep documentation.\n      - Keep and clarify the note for when the class truly is abstract in source (not an R8 artifact). In that case, advise registering an InstanceCreator or TypeAdapter (with link to relevant Gson APIs).\n    - Ensure the section continues to use id “r8-abstract-class” so existing links from exception messages remain valid.\n  - Optionally add cross-references:\n    - Mention that newer Gson versions ship default rules (in META-INF/proguard/gson.pro) which already keep constructors for classes that use Gson annotations, reducing the need for custom rules. However, remind users that non-annotated classes may still need explicit rules.\n\nC) Update Android example README\n\n- File to modify\n  - examples/android-proguard-example/README.md\n\n- Changes\n  - Add a short section:\n    - Explain that newer Gson versions ship default R8/ProGuard rules (gson.pro) which keep constructors for classes using Gson annotations; apps may need fewer custom rules as a result.\n    - Recommend @Keep for Android as a straightforward way to prevent problematic shrinking for classes deserialized with Gson, especially when identifying and maintaining rules is cumbersome.\n    - Clarify the choice between -keep and -keepclassmembers in the context of keeping constructors and preventing unintended class abstraction.\n    - Link to the Troubleshooting Guide section for the abstract class issue and to the Android @Keep docs.\n\nD) Adjust exception message to always link to Troubleshooting Guide in abstract cases\n\n- File to modify\n  - gson/src/main/java/com/google/gson/internal/ConstructorConstructor.java\n\n- Methods/blocks to change\n  - Method: checkInstantiable(Class<?>)\n    - Abstract class branch (currently checks c.getDeclaredConstructors().length == 0 to decide whether to include the Troubleshooting link):\n      - Remove that conditional gating of the Troubleshooting link. Always include the Troubleshooting Guide URL for abstract classes.\n      - Keep the “class is actually abstract” guidance in the doc; the message can point to the same guide section where both the R8-induced and truly-abstract cases are covered.\n\n- Integration\n  - This change will propagate to all places where checkInstantiable participates in constructing error messages, including UnsafeAllocator’s assertInstantiable path. The result is consistent guidance for users encountering abstract class instantiation errors.\n\nE) Optional tests and verification (if the project maintains tests for these areas)\n\n- Add/update R8 integration tests to validate:\n  - A class with a field annotated with @SerializedName (or other covered annotations) is not made abstract and retains its constructors after shrinking.\n- Add/update unit test for exception messaging:\n  - Verify that for an abstract class (irrespective of constructor presence), the thrown JsonIOException message includes the Troubleshooting link.\n- Note: If R8 integration tests are too heavy for CI, at least adjust any existing tests that assert on exact messages to accommodate the appended URL.\n\n4) Considerations\n\n- Impact on existing functionality\n  - Default gson.pro rules will keep more code than before, but only for classes that use Gson annotations. This should be a reasonable trade-off and improve reliability considerably.\n  - Exception message text will change for abstract-class errors to consistently include a URL. This is not API-breaking, but any tests or tooling that assert exact message text may need updates.\n  - Documentation changes do not affect runtime behavior but provide clearer guidance and alternatives.\n\n- Backward compatibility\n  - The added shrinker rules are additive and conservative (scoped to annotated classes).\n  - Exception signature and types remain unchanged; only message content is augmented.\n  - Troubleshooting anchors must remain stable (retain “r8-abstract-class”) to keep links valid.\n\n- Dependencies and prerequisites\n  - The added ProGuard/R8 rules rely on features available in modern versions of these tools (e.g., -if and keepclasseswithmembers). These are widely supported in current Android toolchains and ProGuard.\n  - Ensure annotations are retained at runtime as needed (RuntimeVisibleAnnotations). R8/ProGuard generally preserve runtime-visible annotations by default; no additional keepattributes are expected to be required in gson.pro for Gson annotations, but the example README can remind app developers to consider annotation retention if they use additional annotation processing or atypical configurations.\n\n- Edge cases\n  - Projects that disable Unsafe via GsonBuilder.disableJdkUnsafe(): The Troubleshooting Guide must clearly state that keeping constructors or preventing abstracting won’t help if the class has no accessible no-args constructor; they must add a no-args constructor, register an InstanceCreator, or provide a TypeAdapter.\n  - Classes truly abstract in source: The Troubleshooting section should clearly separate R8-induced abstracting from genuinely abstract classes, with guidance for both.\n\nThis plan updates the default shrinker configuration to cover the most common and reliable signals of Gson usage (annotations), improves user guidance for both Java and Kotlin (especially Android), and ensures troubleshooting links appear consistently in exception messages." additional_kwargs={'refusal': None} response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 7032, 'prompt_tokens': 13349, 'total_tokens': 20381, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'reasoning_tokens': 4544, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': 0, 'cached_tokens': 13312}}, 'model_name': 'gpt-5-2025-08-07', 'system_fingerprint': None, 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None} id='run--eb8e596d-f524-481a-84d0-259d9c2748dd-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 13349, 'output_tokens': 7032, 'total_tokens': 20381, 'input_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'cache_read': 13312}, 'output_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'reasoning': 4544}}

content='--- BEGIN ISSUE INFO ---\nIssue title:\nImprove default ProGuard / R8 rules and Troubleshooting Guide\n\nIssue description: \n# Problem solved by the feature\nImprove the default ProGuard / R8 rules in `META-INF/proguard/gson.pro` added by #2397, and the Troubleshooting Guide.\n\n# Feature description\nI was testing the new default rules with an Android app and Kotlin classes, and there might be the following areas to improve.\n\n### Troubleshooting Guide: `JsonIOException`: \'Abstract classes can\'t be instantiated!\' (R8)\n\nThe Troubleshooting Guide currently suggests the following:\n```\n# Keep the no-args constructor of the deserialized class\n-keepclassmembers class com.example.MyClass {\n  <init>();\n}\n```\n\nThis means only the no-args constructor is kept, but not any other constructors. However, especially for Kotlin I assume it is common that classes don\'t have a no-args constructor because you might declare properties and the primary constructor at once, e.g. `class MyClass(val s: String)` (see [Kotlin documentation](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/classes.html#constructors)). Not sure though if using that is a good idea in combination with Gson because it then requires JDK Unsafe to create instances, but that is a different topic.\n\nSo there are two questions:\n- Should the Troubleshooting Guide rather recommend `<init>(...);` (all constructors), so that the users don\'t experience issues with R8 anymore (but implicitly depend on JDK Unsafe; using `GsonBuilder.disableJdkUnsafe()` would cause Gson to fail with a different exception)\n- Should the Troubleshooting Guide recommend `-keep` instead of `-keepclassmembers`. In case the `<init>` rule for the class properly matches a constructor it might not matter. But in case `<init>();` is used, but a no-args constructor does not exist, then `-keep` seems to at least have the side-effect that R8 does not make the class abstract (and then using JDK Unsafe an instance can be created).\n\n### Troubleshooting Guide: Recommend `@Keep` for Android\nInstead of configuring ProGuard / R8 rules, it might be easier for Android developers to use `@Keep` on the corresponding class or constructor, see https://developer.android.com/studio/write/annotations#keep\n\n### Preventing R8 from making classes abstract / removing no-args constructor\n\nIt would be good if we could adjust the default rules to avoid the "Abstract classes can\'t be instantiated!" exception (for most cases) in the first place.\n\nThere is probably no general way to detect if a class might be used with Gson, but the most reliable variant might be to keep the constructor if any of the Gson annotations is used by a class.\n\nThis can probably be achieved with an [`-if` rule](https://www.guardsquare.com/manual/configuration/usage#if) (see also [answers to this Stack Overflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/q/63162818)). For example:\n```\n# If class has fields with `@SerializedName` annotation keep its constructors\n-if class * {\n  @com.google.gson.annotations.SerializedName <fields>;\n}\n-keep class <1> {\n  <init>(...);\n}\n```\n(duplicated for all Gson annotations)\n\nBut it looks like this is not enough, maybe because there is no `-keep` (or `-keepclasseswithmembers`) rule for the class in the first place so `-if` somehow has no effect? You additionally need the following (duplicated for all Gson annotations probably):\n```\n-keepclasseswithmembers class * {\n  @com.google.gson.annotations.SerializedName <fields>;\n}\n```\nOnly then the class is not made abstract and the constructor is properly kept...\n\n(As side note: Having only the `-keepclasseswithmembers ... { @SerializedName }` above, but not the `-if ... -keep` seems to prevent R8 from making the class abstract, but still removes all constructors, so users would be dependent on JDK Unsafe then.)\n\nOr similar to https://github.com/google/gson/issues/2379#issuecomment-1564517629 maybe the following would work as well:\n```\n-keepclasseswithmembers class * {\n  <init>(...);\n  @com.google.gson.annotations.SerializedName <fields>;\n}\n```\nThere is however probably no need for the `-if` rule shown in the original comment, unless that has some special effect, see https://github.com/google/gson/pull/2397#issuecomment-1575236086.\n\n### R8 makes class abstract but still keeps constructors\n\nIt also looks like the Android app build creates (for some reason) additional constructors / keeps constructors even when the class is made abstract. Due to this, the Troubleshooting Guide URLs are unfortunately not included in the exception messages (they are only added at the moment when there are no constructors).\nNot really sure why these constructors exist in the first place and are kept even when the class is made abstract. In the R8 integration test of Gson this behavior was not seen.\n\nMaybe we should remove the `getDeclaredConstructors().length == 0` check if the class is abstract and always refer to the Troubleshooting Guide. The guide would have to be adjusted then though to also properly cover the case where the class was indeed abstract in the source code.\n\n---\n\nAny additional feedback is highly appreciated!\n\n\nIssue comments:\n\n--- END ISSUE INFO ---\n\nContext Found:\n--- BEGIN CONTEXT ---\nFile: Troubleshooting.md\nLine number range: 1 - 329\nContent:\n1. # Troubleshooting Guide\n2. \n3. This guide describes how to troubleshoot common issues when using Gson.\n4. \n5. <!-- The \'<a id="..."></a>\' anchors below are used to create stable links; don\'t remove or rename them -->\n6. <!-- Use only lowercase IDs, GitHub seems to not support uppercase IDs, see also https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/50962 -->\n7. \n8. ## <a id="class-cast-exception"></a> `ClassCastException` when using deserialized object\n9. \n10. **Symptom:** `ClassCastException` is thrown when accessing an object deserialized by Gson\n11. \n12. **Reason:** Your code is most likely not type-safe\n13. \n14. **Solution:** Make sure your code adheres to the following:\n15. \n16. - Avoid raw types: Instead of calling `fromJson(..., List.class)`, create for example a `TypeToken<List<MyClass>>`.\n17.   See the [user guide](UserGuide.md#collections-examples) for more information.\n18. - When using `TypeToken` prefer the `Gson.fromJson` overloads with `TypeToken` parameter such as [`fromJson(Reader, TypeToken)`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/Gson.html#fromJson(java.io.Reader,com.google.gson.reflect.TypeToken)).\n19.   The overloads with `Type` parameter do not provide any type-safety guarantees.\n20. - When using `TypeToken` make sure you don\'t capture a type variable. For example avoid something like `new TypeToken<List<T>>()` (where `T` is a type variable). Due to Java type erasure the actual type of `T` is not available at runtime. Refactor your code to pass around `TypeToken` instances or use [`TypeToken.getParameterized(...)`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/reflect/TypeToken.html#getParameterized(java.lang.reflect.Type,java.lang.reflect.Type...)), for example `TypeToken.getParameterized(List.class, elementClass)`.\n21. \n22. ## <a id="reflection-inaccessible"></a> `InaccessibleObjectException`: \'module ... does not "opens ..." to unnamed module\'\n23. \n24. **Symptom:** An exception with a message in the form \'module ... does not "opens ..." to unnamed module\' is thrown\n25. \n26. **Reason:** You use Gson by accident to access internal fields of third-party classes\n27. \n28. **Solution:** Write custom Gson [`TypeAdapter`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html) implementations for the affected classes or change the type of your data. If this occurs for a field in one of your classes which you did not actually want to serialize or deserialize in the first place, you can exclude that field, see the [user guide](UserGuide.md#excluding-fields-from-serialization-and-deserialization).\n29. \n30. **Explanation:**\n31. \n32. When no built-in adapter for a type exists and no custom adapter has been registered, Gson falls back to using reflection to access the fields of a class (including `private` ones). Most likely you are seeing this error because you (by accident) rely on the reflection-based adapter for third-party classes. That should be avoided because you make yourself dependent on the implementation details of these classes which could change at any point. For the JDK it is also not possible anymore to access internal fields using reflection starting with JDK 17, see [JEP 403](https://openjdk.org/jeps/403).\n33. \n34. If you want to prevent using reflection on third-party classes in the future you can write your own [`ReflectionAccessFilter`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/ReflectionAccessFilter.html) or use one of the predefined ones, such as `ReflectionAccessFilter.BLOCK_ALL_PLATFORM`.\n35. \n36. ## <a id="reflection-inaccessible-to-module-gson"></a> `InaccessibleObjectException`: \'module ... does not "opens ..." to module com.google.gson\'\n37. \n38. **Symptom:** An exception with a message in the form \'module ... does not "opens ..." to module com.google.gson\' is thrown\n39. \n40. **Reason:**\n41. \n42. - If the reported package is your own package then you have not configured the module declaration of your project to allow Gson to use reflection on your classes.\n43. - If the reported package is from a third party library or the JDK see [this troubleshooting point](#inaccessibleobjectexception-module--does-not-opens--to-unnamed-module).\n44. \n45. **Solution:** Make sure the `module-info.java` file of your project allows Gson to use reflection on your classes, for example:\n46. \n47. ```java\n48. module mymodule {\n49.     requires com.google.gson;\n50. \n51.     opens mypackage to com.google.gson;\n52. }\n53. ```\n54. \n55. Or in case this occurs for a field in one of your classes which you did not actually want to serialize or deserialize in the first place, you can exclude that field, see the [user guide](UserGuide.md#excluding-fields-from-serialization-and-deserialization).\n56. \n57. ## <a id="android-app-random-names"></a> Android app not working in Release mode; random property names\n58. \n59. **Symptom:** Your Android app is working fine in Debug mode but fails in Release mode and the JSON properties have seemingly random names such as `a`, `b`, ...\n60. \n61. **Reason:** You probably have not configured ProGuard / R8 correctly\n62. \n63. **Solution:** Make sure you have configured ProGuard / R8 correctly to preserve the names of your fields. See the [Android example](examples/android-proguard-example/README.md) for more information.\n64. \n65. ## <a id="android-app-broken-after-app-update"></a> Android app unable to parse JSON after app update\n66. \n67. **Symptom:** You released a new version of your Android app and it fails to parse JSON data created by the previous version of your app\n68. \n69. **Reason:** You probably have not configured ProGuard / R8 correctly; probably the fields names are being obfuscated and their naming changed between the versions of your app\n70. \n71. **Solution:** Make sure you have configured ProGuard / R8 correctly to preserve the names of your fields. See the [Android example](examples/android-proguard-example/README.md) for more information.\n72. \n73. If you want to preserve backward compatibility for you app you can use [`@SerializedName`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/annotations/SerializedName.html) on the fields to specify the obfuscated name as alternate, for example: `@SerializedName(value = "myprop", alternate = "a")`\n74. \n75. Normally ProGuard and R8 produce a mapping file, this makes it easier to find out the obfuscated field names instead of having to find them out through trial and error or other means. See the [Android Studio user guide](https://developer.android.com/studio/build/shrink-code.html#retracing) for more information.\n76. \n77. ## <a id="default-field-values-missing"></a> Default field values not present after deserialization\n78. \n79. **Symptom:** You have assign default values to fields but after deserialization the fields have their standard value (such as `null` or `0`)\n80. \n81. **Reason:** Gson cannot invoke the constructor of your class and falls back to JDK `Unsafe` (or similar means)\n82. \n83. **Solution:** Make sure that the class:\n84. \n85. - is `static` (explicitly or implicitly when it is a top-level class)\n86. - has a no-args constructor\n87. \n88. Otherwise Gson will by default try to use JDK `Unsafe` or similar means to create an instance of your class without invoking the constructor and without running any initializers. You can also disable that behavior through [`GsonBuilder.disableJdkUnsafe()`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.html#disableJdkUnsafe()) to notice such issues early on.\n89. \n90. ## <a id="anonymous-local-null"></a> `null` values for anonymous and local classes\n91. \n92. **Symptom:** Objects of a class are always serialized as JSON `null` / always deserialized as Java `null`\n93. \n94. **Reason:** The class you are serializing or deserializing is an anonymous or a local class (or you have specified a custom `ExclusionStrategy`)\n95. \n96. **Solution:** Convert the class to a `static` nested class. If the class is already `static` make sure you have not specified a Gson `ExclusionStrategy` which might exclude the class.\n97. \n98. Notes:\n99. \n100. - "double brace-initialization" also creates anonymous classes\n101. - Local record classes (feature added in Java 16) are supported by Gson and are not affected by this\n102. \n103. ## <a id="map-key-wrong-json"></a> Map keys having unexpected format in JSON\n104. \n105. **Symptom:** JSON output for `Map` keys is unexpected / cannot be deserialized again\n106. \n107. **Reason:** The `Map` key type is \'complex\' and you have not configured the `GsonBuilder` properly\n108. \n109. **Solution:** Use [`GsonBuilder.enableComplexMapKeySerialization()`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.html#enableComplexMapKeySerialization()). See also the [user guide](UserGuide.md#maps-examples) for more information.\n110. \n111. ## <a id="malformed-json"></a> Parsing JSON fails with `MalformedJsonException`\n112. \n113. **Symptom:** JSON parsing fails with `MalformedJsonException`\n114. \n115. **Reason:** The JSON data is actually malformed\n116. \n117. **Solution:** During debugging, log the JSON data right before calling Gson methods or set a breakpoint to inspect the data and make sure it has the expected format. Sometimes APIs might return HTML error pages (instead of JSON data) when reaching rate limits or when other errors occur. Also read the location information of the `MalformedJsonException` exception message, it indicates where exactly in the document the malformed data was detected, including the [JSONPath](https://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/).\n118. \n119. For example, let\'s assume you want to deserialize the following JSON data:\n120. \n121. ```json\n122. {\n123.   "languages": [\n124.     "English",\n125.     "French",\n126.   ]\n127. }\n128. ```\n129. \n130. This will fail with an exception similar to this one: `MalformedJsonException: Use JsonReader.setLenient(true) to accept malformed JSON at line 5 column 4 path $.languages[2]`  \n131. The problem here is the trailing comma (`,`) after `"French"`, trailing commas are not allowed by the JSON specification. The location information "line 5 column 4" points to the `]` in the JSON data (with some slight inaccuracies) because Gson expected another value after `,` instead of the closing `]`. The JSONPath `$.languages[2]` in the exception message also points there: `$.` refers to the root object, `languages` refers to its member of that name and `[2]` refers to the (missing) third value in the JSON array value of that member (numbering starts at 0, so it is `[2]` instead of `[3]`).  \n132. The proper solution here is to fix the malformed JSON data.\n133. \n134. To spot syntax errors in the JSON data easily you can open it in an editor with support for JSON, for example Visual Studio Code. It will highlight within the JSON data the error location and show why the JSON data is considered invalid.\n135. \n136. ## <a id="number-parsed-as-double"></a> Integral JSON number is parsed as `double`\n137. \n138. **Symptom:** JSON data contains an integral number such as `45` but Gson returns it as `double`\n139. \n140. **Reason:** When parsing a JSON number as `Object`, Gson will by default create always return a `double`\n141. \n142. **Solution:** Use [`GsonBuilder.setObjectToNumberStrategy`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.html#setObjectToNumberStrategy(com.google.gson.ToNumberStrategy)) to specify what type of number should be returned\n143. \n144. ## <a id="default-lenient"></a> Malformed JSON not rejected\n145. \n146. **Symptom:** Gson parses malformed JSON without throwing any exceptions\n147. \n148. **Reason:** Due to legacy reasons Gson performs parsing by default in lenient mode\n149. \n150. **Solution:** See [`Gson` class documentation](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/Gson.html#default-lenient) section "Lenient JSON handling"\n151. \n152. Note: Even in non-lenient mode Gson deviates slightly from the JSON specification, see [`JsonReader.setLenient`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/stream/JsonReader.html#setLenient(boolean)) for more details.\n153. \n154. ## <a id="unexpected-json-structure"></a> `IllegalStateException`: "Expected ... but was ..."\n155. \n156. **Symptom:** An `IllegalStateException` with a message in the form "Expected ... but was ..." is thrown\n157. \n158. **Reason:** The JSON data does not have the correct format\n159. \n160. **Solution:** Make sure that your classes correctly model the JSON data. Also during debugging log the JSON data right before calling Gson methods or set a breakpoint to inspect the data and make sure it has the expected format. Read the location information of the exception message, it indicates where exactly in the document the error occurred, including the [JSONPath](https://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/).\n161. \n162. For example, let\'s assume you have the following Java class:\n163. \n164. ```java\n165. class WebPage {\n166.     String languages;\n167. }\n168. ```\n169. \n170. And you want to deserialize the following JSON data:\n171. \n172. ```json\n173. {\n174.   "languages": ["English", "French"]\n175. }\n176. ```\n177. \n178. This will fail with an exception similar to this one: `IllegalStateException: Expected a string but was BEGIN_ARRAY at line 2 column 17 path $.languages`  \n179. This means Gson expected a JSON string value but found the beginning of a JSON array (`[`). The location information "line 2 column 17" points to the `[` in the JSON data (with some slight inaccuracies), so does the JSONPath `$.languages` in the exception message. It refers to the `languages` member of the root object (`$.`).  \n180. The solution here is to change in the `WebPage` class the field `String languages` to `List<String> languages`.\n181. \n182. ## <a id="adapter-not-null-safe"></a> `IllegalStateException`: "Expected ... but was NULL"\n183. \n184. **Symptom:** An `IllegalStateException` with a message in the form "Expected ... but was NULL" is thrown\n185. \n186. **Reason:**\n187. \n188. - A built-in adapter does not support JSON null values\n189. - You have written a custom `TypeAdapter` which does not properly handle JSON null values\n190. \n191. **Solution:** If this occurs for a custom adapter you wrote, add code similar to the following at the beginning of its `read` method:\n192. \n193. ```java\n194. @Override\n195. public MyClass read(JsonReader in) throws IOException {\n196.     if (in.peek() == JsonToken.NULL) {\n197.         in.nextNull();\n198.         return null;\n199.     }\n200. \n201.     ...\n202. }\n203. ```\n204. \n205. Alternatively you can call [`nullSafe()`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html#nullSafe()) on the adapter instance you created.\n206. \n207. ## <a id="serialize-nulls"></a> Properties missing in JSON\n208. \n209. **Symptom:** Properties are missing in the JSON output\n210. \n211. **Reason:** Gson by default omits JSON null from the output (or: ProGuard / R8 is not configured correctly and removed unused fields)\n212. \n213. **Solution:** Use [`GsonBuilder.serializeNulls()`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.html#serializeNulls())\n214. \n215. Note: Gson does not support anonymous and local classes and will serialize them as JSON null, see the [related troubleshooting point](#null-values-for-anonymous-and-local-classes).\n216. \n217. ## <a id="android-internal-fields"></a> JSON output changes for newer Android versions\n218. \n219. **Symptom:** The JSON output differs when running on newer Android versions\n220. \n221. **Reason:** You use Gson by accident to access internal fields of Android classes\n222. \n223. **Solution:** Write custom Gson [`TypeAdapter`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html) implementations for the affected classes or change the type of your data\n224. \n225. **Explanation:**\n226. \n227. When no built-in adapter for a type exists and no custom adapter has been registered, Gson falls back to using reflection to access the fields of a class (including `private` ones). Most likely you are experiencing this issue because you (by accident) rely on the reflection-based adapter for Android classes. That should be avoided because you make yourself dependent on the implementation details of these classes which could change at any point.\n228. \n229. If you want to prevent using reflection on third-party classes in the future you can write your own [`ReflectionAccessFilter`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/ReflectionAccessFilter.html) or use one of the predefined ones, such as `ReflectionAccessFilter.BLOCK_ALL_PLATFORM`.\n230. \n231. ## <a id="json-static-fields"></a> JSON output contains values of `static` fields\n232. \n233. **Symptom:** The JSON output contains values of `static` fields\n234. \n235. **Reason:** You used `GsonBuilder.excludeFieldsWithModifiers` to overwrite the default excluded modifiers\n236. \n237. **Solution:** When calling `GsonBuilder.excludeFieldsWithModifiers` you overwrite the default excluded modifiers. Therefore, you have to explicitly exclude `static` fields if desired. This can be done by adding `Modifier.STATIC` as additional argument.\n238. \n239. ## <a id="no-such-method-error"></a> `NoSuchMethodError` when calling Gson methods\n240. \n241. **Symptom:** A `java.lang.NoSuchMethodError` is thrown when trying to call certain Gson methods\n242. \n243. **Reason:**\n244. \n245. - You have multiple versions of Gson on your classpath\n246. - Or, the Gson version you compiled against is different from the one on your classpath\n247. - Or, you are using a code shrinking tool such as ProGuard or R8 which removed methods from Gson\n248. \n249. **Solution:** First disable any code shrinking tools such as ProGuard or R8 and check if the issue persists. If not, you have to tweak the configuration of that tool to not modify Gson classes. Otherwise verify that the Gson JAR on your classpath is the same you are compiling against, and that there is only one Gson JAR on your classpath. See [this Stack Overflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/q/227486) to find out where a class is loaded from. For example, for debugging you could include the following code:\n250. \n251. ```java\n252. System.out.println(Gson.class.getProtectionDomain().getCodeSource().getLocation());\n253. ```\n254. \n255. If that fails with a `NullPointerException` you have to try one of the other ways to find out where a class is loaded from.\n256. \n257. ## <a id="duplicate-fields"></a> `IllegalArgumentException`: \'Class ... declares multiple JSON fields named \'...\'\'\n258. \n259. **Symptom:** An exception with the message \'Class ... declares multiple JSON fields named \'...\'\' is thrown\n260. \n261. **Reason:**\n262. \n263. - The name you have specified with a [`@SerializedName`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/annotations/SerializedName.html) annotation for a field collides with the name of another field\n264. - The [`FieldNamingStrategy`](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/FieldNamingStrategy.html) you have specified produces conflicting field names\n265. - A field of your class has the same name as the field of a superclass\n266. \n267. Gson prevents multiple fields with the same name because during deserialization it would be ambiguous for which field the JSON data should be deserialized. For serialization it would cause the same field to appear multiple times in JSON. While the JSON specification permits this, it is likely that the application parsing the JSON data will not handle it correctly.\n268. \n269. **Solution:** First identify the fields with conflicting names based on the exception message. Then decide if you want to rename one of them using the [`@SerializedName`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/annotations/SerializedName.html) annotation, or if you want to [exclude](UserGuide.md#excluding-fields-from-serialization-and-deserialization) one of them. When excluding one of the fields you have to include it for both serialization and deserialization (even if your application only performs one of these actions) because the duplicate field check cannot differentiate between these actions.\n270. \n271. ## <a id="java-lang-class-unsupported"></a> `UnsupportedOperationException` when serializing or deserializing `java.lang.Class`\n272. \n273. **Symptom:** An `UnsupportedOperationException` is thrown when trying to serialize or deserialize `java.lang.Class`\n274. \n275. **Reason:** Gson intentionally does not permit serializing and deserializing `java.lang.Class` for security reasons. Otherwise a malicious user could make your application load an arbitrary class from the classpath and, depending on what your application does with the `Class`, in the worst case perform a remote code execution attack.\n276. \n277. **Solution:** First check if you really need to serialize or deserialize a `Class`. Often it is possible to use string aliases and then map them to the known `Class`; you could write a custom [`TypeAdapter`](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html) to do this. If the `Class` values are not known in advance, try to introduce a common base class or interface for all these classes and then verify that the deserialized class is a subclass. For example assuming the base class is called `MyBaseClass`, your custom `TypeAdapter` should load the class like this:\n278. \n279. ```java\n280. Class.forName(jsonString, false, getClass().getClassLoader()).asSubclass(MyBaseClass.class)\n281. ```\n282. \n283. This will not initialize arbitrary classes, and it will throw a `ClassCastException` if the loaded class is not the same as or a subclass of `MyBaseClass`.\n284. \n285. ## <a id="type-token-raw"></a> `IllegalStateException`: \'TypeToken must be created with a type argument\' <br> `RuntimeException`: \'Missing type parameter\'\n286. \n287. **Symptom:** An `IllegalStateException` with the message \'TypeToken must be created with a type argument\' is thrown.  \n288. For older Gson versions a `RuntimeException` with message \'Missing type parameter\' is thrown.\n289. \n290. **Reason:**\n291. \n292. - You created a `TypeToken` without type argument, for example `new TypeToken() {}` (note the missing `<...>`). You always have to provide the type argument, for example like this: `new TypeToken<List<String>>() {}`. Normally the compiler will also emit a \'raw types\' warning when you forget the `<...>`.\n293. - You are using a code shrinking tool such as ProGuard or R8 (Android app builds normally have this enabled by default) but have not configured it correctly for usage with Gson.\n294. \n295. **Solution:** When you are using a code shrinking tool such as ProGuard or R8 you have to adjust your configuration to include the following rules:\n296. \n297. ```\n298. # Keep generic signatures; needed for correct type resolution\n299. -keepattributes Signature\n300. \n301. # Keep class TypeToken (respectively its generic signature)\n302. -keep class com.google.gson.reflect.TypeToken { *; }\n303. \n304. # Keep any (anonymous) classes extending TypeToken\n305. -keep class * extends com.google.gson.reflect.TypeToken\n306. ```\n307. \n308. See also the [Android example](examples/android-proguard-example/README.md) for more information.\n309. \n310. Note: For newer Gson versions these rules might be applied automatically; make sure you are using the latest Gson version and the latest version of the code shrinking tool.\n311. \n312. ## <a id="r8-abstract-class"></a> `JsonIOException`: \'Abstract classes can\'t be instantiated!\' (R8)\n313. \n314. **Symptom:** A `JsonIOException` with the message \'Abstract classes can\'t be instantiated!\' is thrown; the class mentioned in the exception message is not actually `abstract` in your source code, and you are using the code shrinking tool R8 (Android app builds normally have this configured by default).\n315. \n316. **Reason:** The code shrinking tool R8 performs optimizations where it removes the no-args constructor from a class and makes the class `abstract`. Due to this Gson cannot create an instance of the class.\n317. \n318. **Solution:** Make sure the class has a no-args constructor, then adjust your R8 configuration file to keep the constructor of the class. For example:\n319. \n320. ```\n321. # Keep the no-args constructor of the deserialized class\n322. -keepclassmembers class com.example.MyClass {\n323.   <init>();\n324. }\n325. ```\n326. \n327. For Android you can add this rule to the `proguard-rules.pro` file, see also the [Android documentation](https://developer.android.com/build/shrink-code#keep-code). In case the class name in the exception message is obfuscated, see the Android documentation about [retracing](https://developer.android.com/build/shrink-code#retracing).\n328. \n329. Note: If the class which you are trying to deserialize is actually abstract, then this exception is probably unrelated to R8 and you will have to implement a custom [`InstanceCreator`](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/InstanceCreator.html) or [`TypeAdapter`](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html) which creates an instance of a non-abstract subclass of the class.\n\n\nFile: examples/android-proguard-example/README.md\nLine number range: 1 - 17\nContent:\n1. # android-proguard-example\n2. \n3. Example Android project showing how to properly configure [ProGuard](https://www.guardsquare.com/proguard).\n4. ProGuard is a tool for \'shrinking\' and obfuscating compiled classes. It can rename methods and fields,\n5. or remove them if they appear to be unused. This can cause issues for Gson which uses Java reflection to\n6. access the fields of a class. It is necessary to configure ProGuard to make sure that Gson works correctly.\n7. \n8. Also have a look at the [ProGuard manual](https://www.guardsquare.com/manual/configuration/usage#keepoverview)\n9. and the [ProGuard Gson examples](https://www.guardsquare.com/manual/configuration/examples#gson) for more\n10. details on how ProGuard can be configured.\n11. \n12. The R8 code shrinker uses the same rule format as ProGuard, but there are differences between these two\n13. tools. Have a look at R8\'s Compatibility FAQ, and especially at the [Gson section](https://r8.googlesource.com/r8/+/refs/heads/main/compatibility-faq.md#gson).\n14. \n15. Note that newer Gson versions apply some of the rules shown in `proguard.cfg` automatically by default,\n16. see the file [`gson/META-INF/proguard/gson.pro`](/gson/src/main/resources/META-INF/proguard/gson.pro) for\n17. the Gson version you are using.\n\n\nFile: gson/src/main/java/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.java\nLine number range: 103 - 106\nContent:\n103.   private boolean generateNonExecutableJson = DEFAULT_JSON_NON_EXECUTABLE;\n104.   private boolean lenient = DEFAULT_LENIENT;\n105.   private boolean useJdkUnsafe = DEFAULT_USE_JDK_UNSAFE;\n106.   private ToNumberStrategy objectToNumberStrategy = DEFAULT_OBJECT_TO_NUMBER_STRATEGY;\n\n\nFile: gson/src/main/java/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.java\nLine number range: 756 - 760\nContent:\n756.   @CanIgnoreReturnValue\n757.   public GsonBuilder disableJdkUnsafe() {\n758.     this.useJdkUnsafe = false;\n759.     return this;\n760.   }\n\n\nFile: gson/src/main/java/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.java\nLine number range: 806 - 813\nContent:\n806.     return new Gson(excluder, fieldNamingPolicy, new HashMap<>(instanceCreators),\n807.         serializeNulls, complexMapKeySerialization,\n808.         generateNonExecutableJson, escapeHtmlChars, formattingStyle, lenient,\n809.         serializeSpecialFloatingPointValues, useJdkUnsafe, longSerializationPolicy,\n810.         datePattern, dateStyle, timeStyle, new ArrayList<>(this.factories),\n811.         new ArrayList<>(this.hierarchyFactories), factories,\n812.         objectToNumberStrategy, numberToNumberStrategy, new ArrayList<>(reflectionFilters));\n813.   }\n\n\nFile: gson/src/main/java/com/google/gson/JsonIOException.java\nLine number range: 16 - 45\nContent:\n16. package com.google.gson;\n17. \n18. /**\n19.  * This exception is raised when Gson was unable to read an input stream\n20.  * or write to one.\n21.  * \n22.  * @author Inderjeet Singh\n23.  * @author Joel Leitch\n24.  */\n25. public final class JsonIOException extends JsonParseException {\n26.   private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;\n27. \n28.   public JsonIOException(String msg) {\n29.     super(msg);\n30.   }\n31. \n32.   public JsonIOException(String msg, Throwable cause) {\n33.     super(msg, cause);\n34.   }\n35. \n36.   /**\n37.    * Creates exception with the specified cause.

Do NOT explore for more context in the codebase!\n\nAnalyzer agent has analyzed the issue and provided instruction on the issue:\n--- BEGIN ANALYZER MESSAGE ---\nBelow is a high-level analysis and implementation plan to improve the default ProGuard/R8 rules and the Troubleshooting Guide as requested.\n\n1) Feature Understanding\n\n- Goal\n  - Reduce/avoid R8-induced “Abstract classes can\'t be instantiated!” failures for Gson users by improving the default ProGuard/R8 rules shipped with Gson (META-INF/proguard/gson.pro).\n  - Improve the Troubleshooting Guide to provide correct and practical guidance for Java and Kotlin users (especially Android), including the recommendation to use @Keep and to keep all constructors, not just the no-args constructor.\n  - Ensure the exception messaging points users to the Troubleshooting Guide even when R8 makes a class abstract but does not remove all constructors.\n\n- Desired functionality and requirements\n  - Default shrinker rules should:\n    - Prevent R8 from making classes abstract or stripping constructors when a class is likely used with Gson.\n    - Achieve this without over-keeping too many classes (limit to classes using Gson annotations).\n  - Troubleshooting Guide should:\n    - Recommend keeping all constructors (<init>(...)) rather than only the no-args constructor.\n    - Explain implications for Kotlin classes that have no no-args constructor and how this interacts with Unsafe and GsonBuilder.disableJdkUnsafe().\n    - Prefer -keep over -keepclassmembers where it helps avoid unwanted abstracting, and suggest Android’s @Keep annotation as a simpler alternative.\n    - Cover the “class is truly abstract” scenario as a legitimate case with guidance (use InstanceCreator or TypeAdapter).\n  - Exception messages:\n    - Always link to the Troubleshooting Guide for the abstract class error, even if R8 kept some constructors.\n\n- Ambiguities and edge cases to clarify\n  - Which exact rule mechanism to use (-if + -keep vs -keepclasseswithmembers that matches both annotations and constructors): The issue indicates some combinations are required for best results across R8 behaviors. We should adopt a robust combination to maximize effectiveness while minimizing over-keeping.\n  - Which annotations to consider: At minimum @SerializedName and @JsonAdapter. To be safe and consistent, also consider @Expose, @Since, and @Until, because their presence strongly implies Gson usage.\n  - Unsafe disabled case: If GsonBuilder.disableJdkUnsafe() is used and the class has no no-args constructor, keeping constructors or avoiding abstract class might still not allow Gson to instantiate the class. The guide needs to warn and suggest alternatives.\n\n2) Architecture Analysis\n\n- Files/modules to modify\n  - gson/src/main/resources/META-INF/proguard/gson.pro\n    - Add rules to preserve constructors and avoid class abstracting for classes clearly used with Gson (detected via Gson annotations).\n  - Troubleshooting.md\n    - Update the R8 abstract class section to recommend keeping all constructors and/or using -keep, and document @Keep. Clarify Kotlin behavior and Unsafe implications.\n  - examples/android-proguard-example/README.md\n    - Mention the availability of default library rules, @Keep recommendation for Android, and the updated guidance.\n  - gson/src/main/java/com/google/gson/internal/ConstructorConstructor.java\n    - Adjust checkInstantiable(Class<?>) to always append the Troubleshooting Guide link for abstract class cases (regardless of whether constructors exist), so users get actionable guidance consistently.\n\n- Integration with existing code\n  - The default shrinker rules supplied in META-INF/proguard/gson.pro are already consumed by R8 (Android) and by ProGuard where applicable. Enhancing them improves behavior automatically for consumers.\n  - Exception message changes in ConstructorConstructor integrate with existing error/reporting paths; no changes needed elsewhere.\n  - Documentation updates integrate with existing anchors and links (TroubleshootingGuide.createUrl already constructs the anchor link).\n\n- Architectural constraints and conventions\n  - gson.pro must remain conservative to avoid excessive code retention for consumers.\n  - Troubleshooting.md must keep stable anchor IDs to avoid breaking links in error messages (keep id “r8-abstract-class”).\n  - Exception messaging should remain informative and succinct; adding a link is compatible with current style.\n\n3) Implementation Plan\n\nA) Improve default ProGuard/R8 rules\n\n- File to modify\n  - gson/src/main/resources/META-INF/proguard/gson.pro\n\n- Changes\n  - Add rules that:\n    - Detect classes that likely participate in Gson serialization/deserialization by presence of Gson annotations and keep their constructors to prevent R8 from removing constructors and/or making classes abstract.\n    - Use a combination that is effective with R8:\n      - A keep-classes-with-members rule that matches a constructor (<init>(...)) and a Gson annotation on the class or one of its fields, so the class and its constructors are kept together.\n      - Optionally augment with an -if/-keep pair per annotation to ensure the constructor retention is applied and that the class is not abstracted when the annotation is present. This dual approach mirrors the issue analysis that -if alone wasn’t sufficient and that -keepclasseswithmembers helped avoid abstracting but did not always keep constructors unless the constructor was explicitly part of the rule match.\n  - Annotations to cover:\n    - com.google.gson.annotations.SerializedName (fields; optionally consider methods only if you choose to support that pattern—note ReflectiveTypeAdapterFactory rejects certain method usages of @SerializedName, so keep focus on fields).\n    - com.google.gson.annotations.JsonAdapter (on types and fields).\n    - com.google.gson.annotations.Expose (fields).\n    - com.google.gson.annotations.Since (type and fields).\n    - com.google.gson.annotations.Until (type and fields).\n  - Rationale\n    - These annotations strongly indicate Gson is used for the class. Keeping constructors and preventing class abstraction avoids the “Abstract classes can’t be instantiated!” and constructor removal pitfalls in most practical cases, including Kotlin primary constructor-only classes.\n    - The approach strikes a balance between safety and minimal code size impact: only classes using Gson annotations are targeted.\n\nB) Update Troubleshooting Guide\n\n- File to modify\n  - Troubleshooting.md\n\n- Sections to change\n  - Section with id “r8-abstract-class” (current lines ~312–329).\n    - Replace the current recommendation (keeping only the no-args constructor) with:\n      - Primary recommendation to keep the class and all its constructors (<init>(...)) to prevent R8 from making the class abstract and to preserve constructors.\n      - Clarify that for Kotlin classes which often do not have a no-args constructor, keeping all constructors can avoid R8 abstracting but Gson may still rely on JDK Unsafe for instantiation by default. If Unsafe is disabled via GsonBuilder.disableJdkUnsafe(), deserialization will fail for classes without a usable no-args constructor unless an InstanceCreator or a TypeAdapter is provided.\n      - Recommend using -keep (class) over -keepclassmembers where appropriate, because -keep has the beneficial side effect of preventing class abstraction when a constructor signature match would otherwise fail (e.g., when a no-args constructor does not exist).\n      - Recommend using Android’s @Keep annotation on the class or specific constructor as an easier alternative to writing shrinker rules, and link to Android’s @Keep documentation.\n      - Keep and clarify the note for when the class truly is abstract in source (not an R8 artifact). In that case, advise registering an InstanceCreator or TypeAdapter (with link to relevant Gson APIs).\n    - Ensure the section continues to use id “r8-abstract-class” so existing links from exception messages remain valid.\n  - Optionally add cross-references:\n    - Mention that newer Gson versions ship default rules (in META-INF/proguard/gson.pro) which already keep constructors for classes that use Gson annotations, reducing the need for custom rules. However, remind users that non-annotated classes may still need explicit rules.\n\nC) Update Android example README\n\n- File to modify\n  - examples/android-proguard-example/README.md\n\n- Changes\n  - Add a short section:\n    - Explain that newer Gson versions ship default R8/ProGuard rules (gson.pro) which keep constructors for classes using Gson annotations; apps may need fewer custom rules as a result.\n    - Recommend @Keep for Android as a straightforward way to prevent problematic shrinking for classes deserialized with Gson, especially when identifying and maintaining rules is cumbersome.\n    - Clarify the choice between -keep and -keepclassmembers in the context of keeping constructors and preventing unintended class abstraction.\n    - Link to the Troubleshooting Guide section for the abstract class issue and to the Android @Keep docs.\n\nD) Adjust exception message to always link to Troubleshooting Guide in abstract cases\n\n- File to modify\n  - gson/src/main/java/com/google/gson/internal/ConstructorConstructor.java\n\n- Methods/blocks to change\n  - Method: checkInstantiable(Class<?>)\n    - Abstract class branch (currently checks c.getDeclaredConstructors().length == 0 to decide whether to include the Troubleshooting link):\n      - Remove that conditional gating of the Troubleshooting link. Always include the Troubleshooting Guide URL for abstract classes.\n      - Keep the “class is actually abstract” guidance in the doc; the message can point to the same guide section where both the R8-induced and truly-abstract cases are covered.\n\n- Integration\n  - This change will propagate to all places where checkInstantiable participates in constructing error messages, including UnsafeAllocator’s assertInstantiable path. The result is consistent guidance for users encountering abstract class instantiation errors.\n\nE) Optional tests and verification (if the project maintains tests for these areas)\n\n- Add/update R8 integration tests to validate:\n  - A class with a field annotated with @SerializedName (or other covered annotations) is not made abstract and retains its constructors after shrinking.\n- Add/update unit test for exception messaging:\n  - Verify that for an abstract class (irrespective of constructor presence), the thrown JsonIOException message includes the Troubleshooting link.\n- Note: If R8 integration tests are too heavy for CI, at least adjust any existing tests that assert on exact messages to accommodate the appended URL.\n\n4) Considerations\n\n- Impact on existing functionality\n  - Default gson.pro rules will keep more code than before, but only for classes that use Gson annotations. This should be a reasonable trade-off and improve reliability considerably.\n  - Exception message text will change for abstract-class errors to consistently include a URL. This is not API-breaking, but any tests or tooling that assert exact message text may need updates.\n  - Documentation changes do not affect runtime behavior but provide clearer guidance and alternatives.\n\n- Backward compatibility\n  - The added shrinker rules are additive and conservative (scoped to annotated classes).\n  - Exception signature and types remain unchanged; only message content is augmented.\n  - Troubleshooting anchors must remain stable (retain “r8-abstract-class”) to keep links valid.\n\n- Dependencies and prerequisites\n  - The added ProGuard/R8 rules rely on features available in modern versions of these tools (e.g., -if and keepclasseswithmembers). These are widely supported in current Android toolchains and ProGuard.\n  - Ensure annotations are retained at runtime as needed (RuntimeVisibleAnnotations). R8/ProGuard generally preserve runtime-visible annotations by default; no additional keepattributes are expected to be required in gson.pro for Gson annotations, but the example README can remind app developers to consider annotation retention if they use additional annotation processing or atypical configurations.\n\n- Edge cases\n  - Projects that disable Unsafe via GsonBuilder.disableJdkUnsafe(): The Troubleshooting Guide must clearly state that keeping constructors or preventing abstracting won’t help if the class has no accessible no-args constructor; they must add a no-args constructor, register an InstanceCreator, or provide a TypeAdapter.\n  - Classes truly abstract in source: The Troubleshooting section should clearly separate R8-induced abstracting from genuinely abstract classes, with guidance for both.\n\nThis plan updates the default shrinker configuration to cover the most common and reliable signals of Gson usage (annotations), improves user guidance for both Java and Kotlin (especially Android), and ensures troubleshooting links appear consistently in exception messages.\n--- END ANALYZER MESSAGE ---\n\nIMPORTANT INSTRUCTION:\n- The context provided above should be sufficient for you to make the required code edits. Do NOT explore for more context in the codebase!\n- Do NOT FIND, WRITE or RUN any tests, your change will be tested automatically by reproduction tests and regression tests later!!!\n- Never write any tests yourself!!!

-# Troubleshooting Guide
-
-This guide describes how to troubleshoot common issues when using Gson.
-
-<!-- The '<a id="..."></a>' anchors below are used to create stable links; don't remove or rename them -->
-<!-- Use only lowercase IDs, GitHub seems to not support uppercase IDs, see also https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/50962 -->
-
-## <a id="class-cast-exception"></a> `ClassCastException` when using deserialized object
-
-**Symptom:** `ClassCastException` is thrown when accessing an object deserialized by Gson
-
-**Reason:** Your code is most likely not type-safe
-
-**Solution:** Make sure your code adheres to the following:
-
-- Avoid raw types: Instead of calling `fromJson(..., List.class)`, create for example a `TypeToken<List<MyClass>>`.
-  See the [user guide](UserGuide.md#collections-examples) for more information.
-- When using `TypeToken` prefer the `Gson.fromJson` overloads with `TypeToken` parameter such as [`fromJson(Reader, TypeToken)`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/Gson.html#fromJson(java.io.Reader,com.google.gson.reflect.TypeToken)).
-  The overloads with `Type` parameter do not provide any type-safety guarantees.
-- When using `TypeToken` make sure you don't capture a type variable. For example avoid something like `new TypeToken<List<T>>()` (where `T` is a type variable). Due to Java type erasure the actual type of `T` is not available at runtime. Refactor your code to pass around `TypeToken` instances or use [`TypeToken.getParameterized(...)`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/reflect/TypeToken.html#getParameterized(java.lang.reflect.Type,java.lang.reflect.Type...)), for example `TypeToken.getParameterized(List.class, elementClass)`.
-
-## <a id="reflection-inaccessible"></a> `InaccessibleObjectException`: 'module ... does not "opens ..." to unnamed module'
-
-**Symptom:** An exception with a message in the form 'module ... does not "opens ..." to unnamed module' is thrown
-
-**Reason:** You use Gson by accident to access internal fields of third-party classes
-
-**Solution:** Write custom Gson [`TypeAdapter`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html) implementations for the affected classes or change the type of your data. If this occurs for a field in one of your classes which you did not actually want to serialize or deserialize in the first place, you can exclude that field, see the [user guide](UserGuide.md#excluding-fields-from-serialization-and-deserialization).
-
-**Explanation:**
-
-When no built-in adapter for a type exists and no custom adapter has been registered, Gson falls back to using reflection to access the fields of a class (including `private` ones). Most likely you are seeing this error because you (by accident) rely on the reflection-based adapter for third-party classes. That should be avoided because you make yourself dependent on the implementation details of these classes which could change at any point. For the JDK it is also not possible anymore to access internal fields using reflection starting with JDK 17, see [JEP 403](https://openjdk.org/jeps/403).
-
-If you want to prevent using reflection on third-party classes in the future you can write your own [`ReflectionAccessFilter`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/ReflectionAccessFilter.html) or use one of the predefined ones, such as `ReflectionAccessFilter.BLOCK_ALL_PLATFORM`.
-
-## <a id="reflection-inaccessible-to-module-gson"></a> `InaccessibleObjectException`: 'module ... does not "opens ..." to module com.google.gson'
-
-**Symptom:** An exception with a message in the form 'module ... does not "opens ..." to module com.google.gson' is thrown
-
-**Reason:**
-
-- If the reported package is your own package then you have not configured the module declaration of your project to allow Gson to use reflection on your classes.
-- If the reported package is from a third party library or the JDK see [this troubleshooting point](#inaccessibleobjectexception-module--does-not-opens--to-unnamed-module).
-
-**Solution:** Make sure the `module-info.java` file of your project allows Gson to use reflection on your classes, for example:
-
-```java
-module mymodule {
-    requires com.google.gson;
-
-    opens mypackage to com.google.gson;
-}
-```
-
-Or in case this occurs for a field in one of your classes which you did not actually want to serialize or deserialize in the first place, you can exclude that field, see the [user guide](UserGuide.md#excluding-fields-from-serialization-and-deserialization).
-
-## <a id="android-app-random-names"></a> Android app not working in Release mode; random property names
-
-**Symptom:** Your Android app is working fine in Debug mode but fails in Release mode and the JSON properties have seemingly random names such as `a`, `b`, ...
-
-**Reason:** You probably have not configured ProGuard / R8 correctly
-
-**Solution:** Make sure you have configured ProGuard / R8 correctly to preserve the names of your fields. See the [Android example](examples/android-proguard-example/README.md) for more information.
-
-## <a id="android-app-broken-after-app-update"></a> Android app unable to parse JSON after app update
-
-**Symptom:** You released a new version of your Android app and it fails to parse JSON data created by the previous version of your app
-
-**Reason:** You probably have not configured ProGuard / R8 correctly; probably the fields names are being obfuscated and their naming changed between the versions of your app
-
-**Solution:** Make sure you have configured ProGuard / R8 correctly to preserve the names of your fields. See the [Android example](examples/android-proguard-example/README.md) for more information.
-
-If you want to preserve backward compatibility for you app you can use [`@SerializedName`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/annotations/SerializedName.html) on the fields to specify the obfuscated name as alternate, for example: `@SerializedName(value = "myprop", alternate = "a")`
-
-Normally ProGuard and R8 produce a mapping file, this makes it easier to find out the obfuscated field names instead of having to find them out through trial and error or other means. See the [Android Studio user guide](https://developer.android.com/studio/build/shrink-code.html#retracing) for more information.
-
-## <a id="default-field-values-missing"></a> Default field values not present after deserialization
-
-**Symptom:** You have assign default values to fields but after deserialization the fields have their standard value (such as `null` or `0`)
-
-**Reason:** Gson cannot invoke the constructor of your class and falls back to JDK `Unsafe` (or similar means)
-
-**Solution:** Make sure that the class:
-
-- is `static` (explicitly or implicitly when it is a top-level class)
-- has a no-args constructor
-
-Otherwise Gson will by default try to use JDK `Unsafe` or similar means to create an instance of your class without invoking the constructor and without running any initializers. You can also disable that behavior through [`GsonBuilder.disableJdkUnsafe()`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.html#disableJdkUnsafe()) to notice such issues early on.
-
-## <a id="anonymous-local-null"></a> `null` values for anonymous and local classes
-
-**Symptom:** Objects of a class are always serialized as JSON `null` / always deserialized as Java `null`
-
-**Reason:** The class you are serializing or deserializing is an anonymous or a local class (or you have specified a custom `ExclusionStrategy`)
-
-**Solution:** Convert the class to a `static` nested class. If the class is already `static` make sure you have not specified a Gson `ExclusionStrategy` which might exclude the class.
-
-Notes:
-
-- "double brace-initialization" also creates anonymous classes
-- Local record classes (feature added in Java 16) are supported by Gson and are not affected by this
-
-## <a id="map-key-wrong-json"></a> Map keys having unexpected format in JSON
-
-**Symptom:** JSON output for `Map` keys is unexpected / cannot be deserialized again
-
-**Reason:** The `Map` key type is 'complex' and you have not configured the `GsonBuilder` properly
-
-**Solution:** Use [`GsonBuilder.enableComplexMapKeySerialization()`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.html#enableComplexMapKeySerialization()). See also the [user guide](UserGuide.md#maps-examples) for more information.
-
-## <a id="malformed-json"></a> Parsing JSON fails with `MalformedJsonException`
-
-**Symptom:** JSON parsing fails with `MalformedJsonException`
-
-**Reason:** The JSON data is actually malformed
-
-**Solution:** During debugging, log the JSON data right before calling Gson methods or set a breakpoint to inspect the data and make sure it has the expected format. Sometimes APIs might return HTML error pages (instead of JSON data) when reaching rate limits or when other errors occur. Also read the location information of the `MalformedJsonException` exception message, it indicates where exactly in the document the malformed data was detected, including the [JSONPath](https://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/).
-
-For example, let's assume you want to deserialize the following JSON data:
-
-```json
-{
-  "languages": [
-    "English",
-    "French",
-  ]
-}
-```
-
-This will fail with an exception similar to this one: `MalformedJsonException: Use JsonReader.setLenient(true) to accept malformed JSON at line 5 column 4 path $.languages[2]`  
-The problem here is the trailing comma (`,`) after `"French"`, trailing commas are not allowed by the JSON specification. The location information "line 5 column 4" points to the `]` in the JSON data (with some slight inaccuracies) because Gson expected another value after `,` instead of the closing `]`. The JSONPath `$.languages[2]` in the exception message also points there: `$.` refers to the root object, `languages` refers to its member of that name and `[2]` refers to the (missing) third value in the JSON array value of that member (numbering starts at 0, so it is `[2]` instead of `[3]`).  
-The proper solution here is to fix the malformed JSON data.
-
-To spot syntax errors in the JSON data easily you can open it in an editor with support for JSON, for example Visual Studio Code. It will highlight within the JSON data the error location and show why the JSON data is considered invalid.
-
-## <a id="number-parsed-as-double"></a> Integral JSON number is parsed as `double`
-
-**Symptom:** JSON data contains an integral number such as `45` but Gson returns it as `double`
-
-**Reason:** When parsing a JSON number as `Object`, Gson will by default create always return a `double`
-
-**Solution:** Use [`GsonBuilder.setObjectToNumberStrategy`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.html#setObjectToNumberStrategy(com.google.gson.ToNumberStrategy)) to specify what type of number should be returned
-
-## <a id="default-lenient"></a> Malformed JSON not rejected
-
-**Symptom:** Gson parses malformed JSON without throwing any exceptions
-
-**Reason:** Due to legacy reasons Gson performs parsing by default in lenient mode
-
-**Solution:** See [`Gson` class documentation](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/Gson.html#default-lenient) section "Lenient JSON handling"
-
-Note: Even in non-lenient mode Gson deviates slightly from the JSON specification, see [`JsonReader.setLenient`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/stream/JsonReader.html#setLenient(boolean)) for more details.
-
-## <a id="unexpected-json-structure"></a> `IllegalStateException`: "Expected ... but was ..."
-
-**Symptom:** An `IllegalStateException` with a message in the form "Expected ... but was ..." is thrown
-
-**Reason:** The JSON data does not have the correct format
-
-**Solution:** Make sure that your classes correctly model the JSON data. Also during debugging log the JSON data right before calling Gson methods or set a breakpoint to inspect the data and make sure it has the expected format. Read the location information of the exception message, it indicates where exactly in the document the error occurred, including the [JSONPath](https://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/).
-
-For example, let's assume you have the following Java class:
-
-```java
-class WebPage {
-    String languages;
-}
-```
-
-And you want to deserialize the following JSON data:
-
-```json
-{
-  "languages": ["English", "French"]
-}
-```
-
-This will fail with an exception similar to this one: `IllegalStateException: Expected a string but was BEGIN_ARRAY at line 2 column 17 path $.languages`  
-This means Gson expected a JSON string value but found the beginning of a JSON array (`[`). The location information "line 2 column 17" points to the `[` in the JSON data (with some slight inaccuracies), so does the JSONPath `$.languages` in the exception message. It refers to the `languages` member of the root object (`$.`).  
-The solution here is to change in the `WebPage` class the field `String languages` to `List<String> languages`.
-
-## <a id="adapter-not-null-safe"></a> `IllegalStateException`: "Expected ... but was NULL"
-
-**Symptom:** An `IllegalStateException` with a message in the form "Expected ... but was NULL" is thrown
-
-**Reason:**
-
-- A built-in adapter does not support JSON null values
-- You have written a custom `TypeAdapter` which does not properly handle JSON null values
-
-**Solution:** If this occurs for a custom adapter you wrote, add code similar to the following at the beginning of its `read` method:
-
-```java
-@Override
-public MyClass read(JsonReader in) throws IOException {
-    if (in.peek() == JsonToken.NULL) {
-        in.nextNull();
-        return null;
-    }
-
-    ...
-}
-```
-
-Alternatively you can call [`nullSafe()`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html#nullSafe()) on the adapter instance you created.
-
-## <a id="serialize-nulls"></a> Properties missing in JSON
-
-**Symptom:** Properties are missing in the JSON output
-
-**Reason:** Gson by default omits JSON null from the output (or: ProGuard / R8 is not configured correctly and removed unused fields)
-
-**Solution:** Use [`GsonBuilder.serializeNulls()`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.html#serializeNulls())
-
-Note: Gson does not support anonymous and local classes and will serialize them as JSON null, see the [related troubleshooting point](#null-values-for-anonymous-and-local-classes).
-
-## <a id="android-internal-fields"></a> JSON output changes for newer Android versions
-
-**Symptom:** The JSON output differs when running on newer Android versions
-
-**Reason:** You use Gson by accident to access internal fields of Android classes
-
-**Solution:** Write custom Gson [`TypeAdapter`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html) implementations for the affected classes or change the type of your data
-
-**Explanation:**
-
-When no built-in adapter for a type exists and no custom adapter has been registered, Gson falls back to using reflection to access the fields of a class (including `private` ones). Most likely you are experiencing this issue because you (by accident) rely on the reflection-based adapter for Android classes. That should be avoided because you make yourself dependent on the implementation details of these classes which could change at any point.
-
-If you want to prevent using reflection on third-party classes in the future you can write your own [`ReflectionAccessFilter`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/ReflectionAccessFilter.html) or use one of the predefined ones, such as `ReflectionAccessFilter.BLOCK_ALL_PLATFORM`.
-
-## <a id="json-static-fields"></a> JSON output contains values of `static` fields
-
-**Symptom:** The JSON output contains values of `static` fields
-
-**Reason:** You used `GsonBuilder.excludeFieldsWithModifiers` to overwrite the default excluded modifiers
-
-**Solution:** When calling `GsonBuilder.excludeFieldsWithModifiers` you overwrite the default excluded modifiers. Therefore, you have to explicitly exclude `static` fields if desired. This can be done by adding `Modifier.STATIC` as additional argument.
-
-## <a id="no-such-method-error"></a> `NoSuchMethodError` when calling Gson methods
-
-**Symptom:** A `java.lang.NoSuchMethodError` is thrown when trying to call certain Gson methods
-
-**Reason:**
-
-- You have multiple versions of Gson on your classpath
-- Or, the Gson version you compiled against is different from the one on your classpath
-- Or, you are using a code shrinking tool such as ProGuard or R8 which removed methods from Gson
-
-**Solution:** First disable any code shrinking tools such as ProGuard or R8 and check if the issue persists. If not, you have to tweak the configuration of that tool to not modify Gson classes. Otherwise verify that the Gson JAR on your classpath is the same you are compiling against, and that there is only one Gson JAR on your classpath. See [this Stack Overflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/q/227486) to find out where a class is loaded from. For example, for debugging you could include the following code:
-
-```java
-System.out.println(Gson.class.getProtectionDomain().getCodeSource().getLocation());
-```
-
-If that fails with a `NullPointerException` you have to try one of the other ways to find out where a class is loaded from.
-
-## <a id="duplicate-fields"></a> `IllegalArgumentException`: 'Class ... declares multiple JSON fields named '...''
-
-**Symptom:** An exception with the message 'Class ... declares multiple JSON fields named '...'' is thrown
-
-**Reason:**
-
-- The name you have specified with a [`@SerializedName`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/annotations/SerializedName.html) annotation for a field collides with the name of another field
-- The [`FieldNamingStrategy`](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/FieldNamingStrategy.html) you have specified produces conflicting field names
-- A field of your class has the same name as the field of a superclass
-
-Gson prevents multiple fields with the same name because during deserialization it would be ambiguous for which field the JSON data should be deserialized. For serialization it would cause the same field to appear multiple times in JSON. While the JSON specification permits this, it is likely that the application parsing the JSON data will not handle it correctly.
-
-**Solution:** First identify the fields with conflicting names based on the exception message. Then decide if you want to rename one of them using the [`@SerializedName`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/annotations/SerializedName.html) annotation, or if you want to [exclude](UserGuide.md#excluding-fields-from-serialization-and-deserialization) one of them. When excluding one of the fields you have to include it for both serialization and deserialization (even if your application only performs one of these actions) because the duplicate field check cannot differentiate between these actions.

-## <a id="java-lang-class-unsupported"></a> `UnsupportedOperationException` when serializing or deserializing `java.lang.Class`
-
-**Symptom:** An `UnsupportedOperationException` is thrown when trying to serialize or deserialize `java.lang.Class`
-
-**Reason:** Gson intentionally does not permit serializing and deserializing `java.lang.Class` for security reasons. Otherwise a malicious user could make your application load an arbitrary class from the classpath and, depending on what your application does with the `Class`, in the worst case perform a remote code execution attack.
-
-**Solution:** First check if you really need to serialize or deserialize a `Class`. Often it is possible to use string aliases and then map them to the known `Class`; you could write a custom [`TypeAdapter`](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html) to do this. If the `Class` values are not known in advance, try to introduce a common base class or interface for all these classes and then verify that the deserialized class is a subclass. For example assuming the base class is called `MyBaseClass`, your custom `TypeAdapter` should load the class like this:
-
-```java
-Class.forName(jsonString, false, getClass().getClassLoader()).asSubclass(MyBaseClass.class)
-```
-
-This will not initialize arbitrary classes, and it will throw a `ClassCastException` if the loaded class is not the same as or a subclass of `MyBaseClass`.
-
-## <a id="type-token-raw"></a> `IllegalStateException`: 'TypeToken must be created with a type argument' <br> `RuntimeException`: 'Missing type parameter'
-
-**Symptom:** An `IllegalStateException` with the message 'TypeToken must be created with a type argument' is thrown.  
-For older Gson versions a `RuntimeException` with message 'Missing type parameter' is thrown.
-
-**Reason:**
-
-- You created a `TypeToken` without type argument, for example `new TypeToken() {}` (note the missing `<...>`). You always have to provide the type argument, for example like this: `new TypeToken<List<String>>() {}`. Normally the compiler will also emit a 'raw types' warning when you forget the `<...>`.
-- You are using a code shrinking tool such as ProGuard or R8 (Android app builds normally have this enabled by default) but have not configured it correctly for usage with Gson.
-
-**Solution:** When you are using a code shrinking tool such as ProGuard or R8 you have to adjust your configuration to include the following rules:
-
-```
-# Keep generic signatures; needed for correct type resolution
--keepattributes Signature
-
-# Keep class TypeToken (respectively its generic signature)
--keep class com.google.gson.reflect.TypeToken { *; }
-
-# Keep any (anonymous) classes extending TypeToken
--keep class * extends com.google.gson.reflect.TypeToken
-```
-
-See also the [Android example](examples/android-proguard-example/README.md) for more information.
-
-Note: For newer Gson versions these rules might be applied automatically; make sure you are using the latest Gson version and the latest version of the code shrinking tool.
-
-## <a id="r8-abstract-class"></a> `JsonIOException`: 'Abstract classes can't be instantiated!' (R8)
-
-**Symptom:** A `JsonIOException` with the message 'Abstract classes can't be instantiated!' is thrown; the class mentioned in the exception message is not actually `abstract` in your source code, and you are using the code shrinking tool R8 (Android app builds normally have this configured by default).
-
-**Reason:** The code shrinking tool R8 performs optimizations where it removes the no-args constructor from a class and makes the class `abstract`. Due to this Gson cannot create an instance of the class.
-
-**Solution:** Make sure the class has a no-args constructor, then adjust your R8 configuration file to keep the constructor of the class. For example:
-
-```
-# Keep the no-args constructor of the deserialized class
--keepclassmembers class com.example.MyClass {
-  <init>();
-}
-```
-
-For Android you can add this rule to the `proguard-rules.pro` file, see also the [Android documentation](https://developer.android.com/build/shrink-code#keep-code). In case the class name in the exception message is obfuscated, see the Android documentation about [retracing](https://developer.android.com/build/shrink-code#retracing).
-
-Note: If the class which you are trying to deserialize is actually abstract, then this exception is probably unrelated to R8 and you will have to implement a custom [`InstanceCreator`](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/InstanceCreator.html) or [`TypeAdapter`](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html) which creates an instance of a non-abstract subclass of the class.

+
+## <a id="class-cast-exception"></a> `ClassCastException` when using deserialized object
+
+**Symptom:** `ClassCastException` is thrown when accessing an object deserialized by Gson
+
+**Reason:** Your code is most likely not type-safe
+
+**Solution:** Make sure your code adheres to the following:
+
+- Avoid raw types: Instead of calling `fromJson(..., List.class)`, create for example a `TypeToken<List<MyClass>>`.
+  See the [user guide](UserGuide.md#collections-examples) for more information.
+- When using `TypeToken` prefer the `Gson.fromJson` overloads with `TypeToken` parameter such as [`fromJson(Reader, TypeToken)`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/Gson.html#fromJson(java.io.Reader,com.google.gson.reflect.TypeToken)).
+  The overloads with `Type` parameter do not provide any type-safety guarantees.
+- When using `TypeToken` make sure you don't capture a type variable. For example avoid something like `new TypeToken<List<T>>()` (where `T` is a type variable). Due to Java type erasure the actual type of `T` is not available at runtime. Refactor your code to pass around `TypeToken` instances or use [`TypeToken.getParameterized(...)`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/reflect/TypeToken.html#getParameterized(java.lang.reflect.Type,java.lang.reflect.Type...)), for example `TypeToken.getParameterized(List.class, elementClass)`.
+
+## <a id="reflection-inaccessible"></a> `InaccessibleObjectException`: 'module ... does not "opens ..." to unnamed module'
+
+**Symptom:** An exception with a message in the form 'module ... does not "opens ..." to unnamed module' is thrown
+
+**Reason:** You use Gson by accident to access internal fields of third-party classes
+
+**Solution:** Write custom Gson [`TypeAdapter`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html) implementations for the affected classes or change the type of your data. If this occurs for a field in one of your classes which you did not actually want to serialize or deserialize in the first place, you can exclude that field, see the [user guide](UserGuide.md#excluding-fields-from-serialization-and-deserialization).
+
+**Explanation:**
+
+When no built-in adapter for a type exists and no custom adapter has been registered, Gson falls back to using reflection to access the fields of a class (including `private` ones). Most likely you are seeing this error because you (by accident) rely on the reflection-based adapter for third-party classes. That should be avoided because you make yourself dependent on the implementation details of these classes which could change at any point. For the JDK it is also not possible anymore to access internal fields using reflection starting with JDK 17, see [JEP 403](https://openjdk.org/jeps/403).
+
+If you want to prevent using reflection on third-party classes in the future you can write your own [`ReflectionAccessFilter`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/ReflectionAccessFilter.html) or use one of the predefined ones, such as `ReflectionAccessFilter.BLOCK_ALL_PLATFORM`.
+
+## <a id="reflection-inaccessible-to-module-gson"></a> `InaccessibleObjectException`: 'module ... does not "opens ..." to module com.google.gson'
+
+**Symptom:** An exception with a message in the form 'module ... does not "opens ..." to module com.google.gson' is thrown
+
+**Reason:**
+
+- If the reported package is your own package then you have not configured the module declaration of your project to allow Gson to use reflection on your classes.
+- If the reported package is from a third party library or the JDK see [this troubleshooting point](#inaccessibleobjectexception-module--does-not-opens--to-unnamed-module).
+
+**Solution:** Make sure the `module-info.java` file of your project allows Gson to use reflection on your classes, for example:
+
+```java
+module mymodule {
+    requires com.google.gson;
+
+    opens mypackage to com.google.gson;
+}
+```
+
+Or in case this occurs for a field in one of your classes which you did not actually want to serialize or deserialize in the first place, you can exclude that field, see the [user guide](UserGuide.md#excluding-fields-from-serialization-and-deserialization).
+
+## <a id="android-app-random-names"></a> Android app not working in Release mode; random property names
+
+**Symptom:** Your Android app is working fine in Debug mode but fails in Release mode and the JSON properties have seemingly random names such as `a`, `b`, ...
+
+**Reason:** You probably have not configured ProGuard / R8 correctly
+
+**Solution:** Make sure you have configured ProGuard / R8 correctly to preserve the names of your fields. See the [Android example](examples/android-proguard-example/README.md) for more information.
+
+## <a id="android-app-broken-after-app-update"></a> Android app unable to parse JSON after app update
+
+**Symptom:** You released a new version of your Android app and it fails to parse JSON data created by the previous version of your app
+
+**Reason:** You probably have not configured ProGuard / R8 correctly; probably the fields names are being obfuscated and their naming changed between the versions of your app
+
+**Solution:** Make sure you have configured ProGuard / R8 correctly to preserve the names of your fields. See the [Android example](examples/android-proguard-example/README.md) for more information.
+
+If you want to preserve backward compatibility for you app you can use [`@SerializedName`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/annotations/SerializedName.html) on the fields to specify the obfuscated name as alternate, for example: `@SerializedName(value = "myprop", alternate = "a")`
+
+Normally ProGuard and R8 produce a mapping file, this makes it easier to find out the obfuscated field names instead of having to find them out through trial and error or other means. See the [Android Studio user guide](https://developer.android.com/studio/build/shrink-code.html#retracing) for more information.
+
+## <a id="default-field-values-missing"></a> Default field values not present after deserialization
+
+**Symptom:** You have assign default values to fields but after deserialization the fields have their standard value (such as `null` or `0`)
+
+**Reason:** Gson cannot invoke the constructor of your class and falls back to JDK `Unsafe` (or similar means)
+
+**Solution:** Make sure that the class:
+
+- is `static` (explicitly or implicitly when it is a top-level class)
+- has a no-args constructor
+
+Otherwise Gson will by default try to use JDK `Unsafe` or similar means to create an instance of your class without invoking the constructor and without running any initializers. You can also disable that behavior through [`GsonBuilder.disableJdkUnsafe()`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.html#disableJdkUnsafe()) to notice such issues early on.
+
+## <a id="anonymous-local-null"></a> `null` values for anonymous and local classes
+
+**Symptom:** Objects of a class are always serialized as JSON `null` / always deserialized as Java `null`
+
+**Reason:** The class you are serializing or deserializing is an anonymous or a local class (or you have specified a custom `ExclusionStrategy`)
+
+**Solution:** Convert the class to a `static` nested class. If the class is already `static` make sure you have not specified a Gson `ExclusionStrategy` which might exclude the class.
+
+Notes:
+
+- "double brace-initialization" also creates anonymous classes
+- Local record classes (feature added in Java 16) are supported by Gson and are not affected by this
+
+## <a id="map-key-wrong-json"></a> Map keys having unexpected format in JSON
+
+**Symptom:** JSON output for `Map` keys is unexpected / cannot be deserialized again
+
+**Reason:** The `Map` key type is 'complex' and you have not configured the `GsonBuilder` properly
+
+**Solution:** Use [`GsonBuilder.enableComplexMapKeySerialization()`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.html#enableComplexMapKeySerialization()). See also the [user guide](UserGuide.md#maps-examples) for more information.
+
+## <a id="malformed-json"></a> Parsing JSON fails with `MalformedJsonException`
+
+**Symptom:** JSON parsing fails with `MalformedJsonException`
+
+**Reason:** The JSON data is actually malformed
+
+**Solution:** During debugging, log the JSON data right before calling Gson methods or set a breakpoint to inspect the data and make sure it has the expected format. Sometimes APIs might return HTML error pages (instead of JSON data) when reaching rate limits or when other errors occur. Also read the location information of the `MalformedJsonException` exception message, it indicates where exactly in the document the malformed data was detected, including the [JSONPath](https://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/).
+
+For example, let's assume you want to deserialize the following JSON data:
+
+```json
+{
+  "languages": [
+    "English",
+    "French",
+  ]
+}
+```
+
+This will fail with an exception similar to this one: `MalformedJsonException: Use JsonReader.setLenient(true) to accept malformed JSON at line 5 column 4 path $.languages[2]`  
+The problem here is the trailing comma (`,`) after `"French"`, trailing commas are not allowed by the JSON specification. The location information "line 5 column 4" points to the `]` in the JSON data (with some slight inaccuracies) because Gson expected another value after `,` instead of the closing `]`. The JSONPath `$.languages[2]` in the exception message also points there: `$.` refers to the root object, `languages` refers to its member of that name and `[2]` refers to the (missing) third value in the JSON array value of that member (numbering starts at 0, so it is `[2]` instead of `[3]`).  
+The proper solution here is to fix the malformed JSON data.
+
+To spot syntax errors in the JSON data easily you can open it in an editor with support for JSON, for example Visual Studio Code. It will highlight within the JSON data the error location and show why the JSON data is considered invalid.
+
+## <a id="number-parsed-as-double"></a> Integral JSON number is parsed as `double`
+
+**Symptom:** JSON data contains an integral number such as `45` but Gson returns it as `double`
+
+**Reason:** When parsing a JSON number as `Object`, Gson will by default create always return a `double`
+
+**Solution:** Use [`GsonBuilder.setObjectToNumberStrategy`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.html#setObjectToNumberStrategy(com.google.gson.ToNumberStrategy)) to specify what type of number should be returned
+
+## <a id="default-lenient"></a> Malformed JSON not rejected
+
+**Symptom:** Gson parses malformed JSON without throwing any exceptions
+
+**Reason:** Due to legacy reasons Gson performs parsing by default in lenient mode
+
+**Solution:** See [`Gson` class documentation](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/Gson.html#default-lenient) section "Lenient JSON handling"
+
+Note: Even in non-lenient mode Gson deviates slightly from the JSON specification, see [`JsonReader.setLenient`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/stream/JsonReader.html#setLenient(boolean)) for more details.
+
+## <a id="unexpected-json-structure"></a> `IllegalStateException`: "Expected ... but was ..."
+
+**Symptom:** An `IllegalStateException` with a message in the form "Expected ... but was ..." is thrown
+
+**Reason:** The JSON data does not have the correct format
+
+**Solution:** Make sure that your classes correctly model the JSON data. Also during debugging log the JSON data right before calling Gson methods or set a breakpoint to inspect the data and make sure it has the expected format. Read the location information of the exception message, it indicates where exactly in the document the error occurred, including the [JSONPath](https://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/).
+
+For example, let's assume you have the following Java class:
+
+```java
+class WebPage {
+    String languages;
+}
+```
+
+And you want to deserialize the following JSON data:
+
+```json
+{
+  "languages": ["English", "French"]
+}
+```
+
+This will fail with an exception similar to this one: `IllegalStateException: Expected a string but was BEGIN_ARRAY at line 2 column 17 path $.languages`  
+This means Gson expected a JSON string value but found the beginning of a JSON array (`[`). The location information "line 2 column 17" points to the `[` in the JSON data (with some slight inaccuracies), so does the JSONPath `$.languages` in the exception message. It refers to the `languages` member of the root object (`$.`).  
+The solution here is to change in the `WebPage` class the field `String languages` to `List<String> languages`.
+
+## <a id="adapter-not-null-safe"></a> `IllegalStateException`: "Expected ... but was NULL"
+
+**Symptom:** An `IllegalStateException` with a message in the form "Expected ... but was NULL" is thrown
+
+**Reason:**
+
+- A built-in adapter does not support JSON null values
+- You have written a custom `TypeAdapter` which does not properly handle JSON null values
+
+**Solution:** If this occurs for a custom adapter you wrote, add code similar to the following at the beginning of its `read` method:
+
+```java
+@Override
+public MyClass read(JsonReader in) throws IOException {
+    if (in.peek() == JsonToken.NULL) {
+        in.nextNull();
+        return null;
+    }
+
+    ...
+}
+```
+
+Alternatively you can call [`nullSafe()`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html#nullSafe()) on the adapter instance you created.
+
+## <a id="serialize-nulls"></a> Properties missing in JSON
+
+**Symptom:** Properties are missing in the JSON output
+
+**Reason:** Gson by default omits JSON null from the output (or: ProGuard / R8 is not configured correctly and removed unused fields)
+
+**Solution:** Use [`GsonBuilder.serializeNulls()`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.html#serializeNulls())
+
+Note: Gson does not support anonymous and local classes and will serialize them as JSON null, see the [related troubleshooting point](#null-values-for-anonymous-and-local-classes).
+
+## <a id="android-internal-fields"></a> JSON output changes for newer Android versions
+
+**Symptom:** The JSON output differs when running on newer Android versions
+
+**Reason:** You use Gson by accident to access internal fields of Android classes
+
+**Solution:** Write custom Gson [`TypeAdapter`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html) implementations for the affected classes or change the type of your data
+
+**Explanation:**
+
+When no built-in adapter for a type exists and no custom adapter has been registered, Gson falls back to using reflection to access the fields of a class (including `private` ones). Most likely you are experiencing this issue because you (by accident) rely on the reflection-based adapter for Android classes. That should be avoided because you make yourself dependent on the implementation details of these classes which could change at any point.
+
+If you want to prevent using reflection on third-party classes in the future you can write your own [`ReflectionAccessFilter`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/ReflectionAccessFilter.html) or use one of the predefined ones, such as `ReflectionAccessFilter.BLOCK_ALL_PLATFORM`.
+
+## <a id="json-static-fields"></a> JSON output contains values of `static` fields
+
+**Symptom:** The JSON output contains values of `static` fields
+
+**Reason:** You used `GsonBuilder.excludeFieldsWithModifiers` to overwrite the default excluded modifiers
+
+**Solution:** When calling `GsonBuilder.excludeFieldsWithModifiers` you overwrite the default excluded modifiers. Therefore, you have to explicitly exclude `static` fields if desired. This can be done by adding `Modifier.STATIC` as additional argument.
+
+## <a id="no-such-method-error"></a> `NoSuchMethodError` when calling Gson methods
+
+**Symptom:** A `java.lang.NoSuchMethodError` is thrown when trying to call certain Gson methods
+
+**Reason:**
+
+- You have multiple versions of Gson on your classpath
+- Or, the Gson version you compiled against is different from the one on your classpath
+- Or, you are using a code shrinking tool such as ProGuard or R8 which removed methods from Gson
+
+**Solution:** First disable any code shrinking tools such as ProGuard or R8 and check if the issue persists. If not, you have to tweak the configuration of that tool to not modify Gson classes. Otherwise verify that the Gson JAR on your classpath is the same you are compiling against, and that there is only one Gson JAR on your classpath. See [this Stack Overflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/q/227486) to find out where a class is loaded from. For example, for debugging you could include the following code:
+
+```java
+System.out.println(Gson.class.getProtectionDomain().getCodeSource().getLocation());
+```
+
+If that fails with a `NullPointerException` you have to try one of the other ways to find out where a class is loaded from.
+
+## <a id="duplicate-fields"></a> `IllegalArgumentException`: 'Class ... declares multiple JSON fields named '...''
+
+**Symptom:** An exception with the message 'Class ... declares multiple JSON fields named '...'' is thrown
+
+**Reason:**
+
+- The name you have specified with a [`@SerializedName`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/annotations/SerializedName.html) annotation for a field collides with the name of another field
+- The [`FieldNamingStrategy`](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/FieldNamingStrategy.html) you have specified produces conflicting field names
+- A field of your class has the same name as the field of a superclass
+
+Gson prevents multiple fields with the same name because during deserialization it would be ambiguous for which field the JSON data should be deserialized. For serialization it would cause the same field to appear multiple times in JSON. While the JSON specification permits this, it is likely that the application parsing the JSON data will not handle it correctly.
+
+**Solution:** First identify the fields with conflicting names based on the exception message. Then decide if you want to rename one of them using the [`@SerializedName`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/annotations/SerializedName.html) annotation, or if you want to [exclude](UserGuide.md#excluding-fields-from-serialization-and-deserialization) one of them. When excluding one of the fields you have to include it for both serialization and deserialization (even if your application only performs one of these actions) because the duplicate field check cannot differentiate between these actions.
+
+## <a id="java-lang-class-unsupported"></a> `UnsupportedOperationException` when serializing or deserializing `java.lang.Class`
+
+**Symptom:** An `UnsupportedOperationException` is thrown when trying to serialize or deserialize `java.lang.Class`
+
+**Reason:** Gson intentionally does not permit serializing and deserializing `java.lang.Class` for security reasons. Otherwise a malicious user could make your application load an arbitrary class from the classpath and, depending on what your application does with the `Class`, in the worst case perform a remote code execution attack.
+
+**Solution:** First check if you really need to serialize or deserialize a `Class`. Often it is possible to use string aliases and then map them to the known `Class`; you could write a custom [`TypeAdapter`](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html) to do this. If the `Class` values are not known in advance, try to introduce a common base class or interface for all these classes and then verify that the deserialized class is a subclass. For example assuming the base class is called `MyBaseClass`, your custom `TypeAdapter` should load the class like this:
+
+```java
+Class.forName(jsonString, false, getClass().getClassLoader()).asSubclass(MyBaseClass.class)
+```
+
+This will not initialize arbitrary classes, and it will throw a `ClassCastException` if the loaded class is not the same as or a subclass of `MyBaseClass`.
+
+## <a id="type-token-raw"></a> `IllegalStateException`: 'TypeToken must be created with a type argument' <br> `RuntimeException`: 'Missing type parameter'
+
+**Symptom:** An `IllegalStateException` with the message 'TypeToken must be created with a type argument' is thrown.  
+For older Gson versions a `RuntimeException` with message 'Missing type parameter' is thrown.
+
+**Reason:**
+
+- You created a `TypeToken` without type argument, for example `new TypeToken() {}` (note the missing `<...>`). You always have to provide the type argument, for example like this: `new TypeToken<List<String>>() {}`. Normally the compiler will also emit a 'raw types' warning when you forget the `<...>`.
+- You are using a code shrinking tool such as ProGuard or R8 (Android app builds normally have this enabled by default) but have not configured it correctly for usage with Gson.
+
+**Solution:** When you are using a code shrinking tool such as ProGuard or R8 you have to adjust your configuration to include the following rules:
+
+```
+# Keep generic signatures; needed for correct type resolution
+-keepattributes Signature
+
+# Keep class TypeToken (respectively its generic signature)
+-keep class com.google.gson.reflect.TypeToken { *; }
+
+# Keep any (anonymous) classes extending TypeToken
+-keep class * extends com.google.gson.reflect.TypeToken
+```
+
+See also the [Android example](examples/android-proguard-example/README.md) for more information.
+
+Note: For newer Gson versions these rules might be applied automatically; make sure you are using the latest Gson version and the latest version of the code shrinking tool.
+
+## <a id="r8-abstract-class"></a> `JsonIOException`: 'Abstract classes can't be instantiated!' (R8)
+
+**Symptom:** A `JsonIOException` with the message 'Abstract classes can't be instantiated!' is thrown; the class mentioned in the exception message is not actually `abstract` in your source code, and you are using the code shrinking tool R8 (Android app builds normally have this configured by default).
+
+**Reason:** The code shrinking tool R8 performs optimizations where it removes the no-args constructor from a class and makes the class `abstract`. Due to this Gson cannot create an instance of the class.
+
+**Solution:** Prefer keeping the class and all its constructors to prevent R8 from removing constructors or making the class `abstract`. For example:
+
+```
+# Keep the deserialized class and all its constructors
+-keep class com.example.MyClass {
+  <init>(...);
+}
+```
+
+Using `-keep` rather than `-keepclassmembers` helps ensure the class is not made `abstract`, even if a no-args constructor does not exist.
+
+For Kotlin classes it is common to only have a primary constructor. Keeping all constructors avoids unexpected R8 changes, but Gson may still need to use JDK `Unsafe` to create instances if there is no accessible no-args constructor. If you disable `Unsafe` via `GsonBuilder.disableJdkUnsafe()`, deserialization will fail unless you add a no-args constructor or register an `InstanceCreator` or a `TypeAdapter`.
+
+On Android, an easy alternative is to annotate the class or a specific constructor with [`@Keep`](https://developer.android.com/studio/write/annotations#keep).
+
+Newer Gson versions also ship default rules (`META-INF/proguard/gson.pro`) that automatically keep constructors for classes that use Gson annotations (such as `@SerializedName`, `@JsonAdapter`, `@Expose`, `@Since`, `@Until`), reducing the need for custom rules.
+
+For Android you can add custom rules to the `proguard-rules.pro` file; see also the [Android documentation](https://developer.android.com/build/shrink-code#keep-code). In case the class name in the exception message is obfuscated, see the Android documentation about [retracing](https://developer.android.com/build/shrink-code#retracing).
+
+Note: If the class which you are trying to deserialize is actually abstract, then this exception is probably unrelated to R8 and you will have to implement a custom [`InstanceCreator`](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/InstanceCreator.html) or [`TypeAdapter`](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html) which creates an instance of a non-abstract subclass of the class.

Considerations:\n- Identify potential impacts on existing functionality\n- Consider backward compatibility\n- Note any dependencies or prerequisites\n\nDo NOT provide actual code snippets or diffs. Focus on describing what needs to be implemented.\n\nHere are the details for analysis:\n\nIssue title:\nImprove default ProGuard / R8 rules and Troubleshooting Guide\n\nIssue description: \n# Problem solved by the feature\nImprove the default ProGuard / R8 rules in `META-INF/proguard/gson.pro` added by #2397, and the Troubleshooting Guide.\n\n# Feature description\nI was testing the new default rules with an Android app and Kotlin classes, and there might be the following areas to improve.\n\n### Troubleshooting Guide: `JsonIOException`: \'Abstract classes can\'t be instantiated!\' (R8)\n\nThe Troubleshooting Guide currently suggests the following:\n```\n# Keep the no-args constructor of the deserialized class\n-keepclassmembers class com.example.MyClass {\n  <init>();\n}\n```\n\nThis means only the no-args constructor is kept, but not any other constructors. However, especially for Kotlin I assume it is common that classes don\'t have a no-args constructor because you might declare properties and the primary constructor at once, e.g. `class MyClass(val s: String)` (see [Kotlin documentation](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/classes.html#constructors)). Not sure though if using that is a good idea in combination with Gson because it then requires JDK Unsafe to create instances, but that is a different topic.\n\nSo there are two questions:\n- Should the Troubleshooting Guide rather recommend `<init>(...);` (all constructors), so that the users don\'t experience issues with R8 anymore (but implicitly depend on JDK Unsafe; using `GsonBuilder.disableJdkUnsafe()` would cause Gson to fail with a different exception)\n- Should the Troubleshooting Guide recommend `-keep` instead of `-keepclassmembers`. In case the `<init>` rule for the class properly matches a constructor it might not matter. But in case `<init>();` is used, but a no-args constructor does not exist, then `-keep` seems to at least have the side-effect that R8 does not make the class abstract (and then using JDK Unsafe an instance can be created).\n\n### Troubleshooting Guide: Recommend `@Keep` for Android\nInstead of configuring ProGuard / R8 rules, it might be easier for Android developers to use `@Keep` on the corresponding class or constructor, see https://developer.android.com/studio/write/annotations#keep\n\n### Preventing R8 from making classes abstract / removing no-args constructor\n\nIt would be good if we could adjust the default rules to avoid the "Abstract classes can\'t be instantiated!" exception (for most cases) in the first place.\n\nThere is probably no general way to detect if a class might be used with Gson, but the most reliable variant might be to keep the constructor if any of the Gson annotations is used by a class.\n\nThis can probably be achieved with an [`-if` rule](https://www.guardsquare.com/manual/configuration/usage#if) (see also [answers to this Stack Overflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/q/63162818)). For example:\n```\n# If class has fields with `@SerializedName` annotation keep its constructors\n-if class * {\n  @com.google.gson.annotations.SerializedName <fields>;\n}\n-keep class <1> {\n  <init>(...);\n}\n```\n(duplicated for all Gson annotations)\n\nBut it looks like this is not enough, maybe because there is no `-keep` (or `-keepclasseswithmembers`) rule for the class in the first place so `-if` somehow has no effect? You additionally need the following (duplicated for all Gson annotations probably):\n```\n-keepclasseswithmembers class * {\n  @com.google.gson.annotations.SerializedName <fields>;\n}\n```\nOnly then the class is not made abstract and the constructor is properly kept...\n\n(As side note: Having only the `-keepclasseswithmembers ... { @SerializedName }` above, but not the `-if ... -keep` seems to prevent R8 from making the class abstract, but still removes all constructors, so users would be dependent on JDK Unsafe then.)\n\nOr similar to https://github.com/google/gson/issues/2379#issuecomment-1564517629 maybe the following would work as well:\n```\n-keepclasseswithmembers class * {\n  <init>(...);\n  @com.google.gson.annotations.SerializedName <fields>;\n}\n```\nThere is however probably no need for the `-if` rule shown in the original comment, unless that has some special effect, see https://github.com/google/gson/pull/2397#issuecomment-1575236086.\n\n### R8 makes class abstract but still keeps constructors\n\nIt also looks like the Android app build creates (for some reason) additional constructors / keeps constructors even when the class is made abstract. Due to this, the Troubleshooting Guide URLs are unfortunately not included in the exception messages (they are only added at the moment when there are no constructors).\nNot really sure why these constructors exist in the first place and are kept even when the class is made abstract. In the R8 integration test of Gson this behavior was not seen.\n\nMaybe we should remove the `getDeclaredConstructors().length == 0` check if the class is abstract and always refer to the Troubleshooting Guide. The guide would have to be adjusted then though to also properly cover the case where the class was indeed abstract in the source code.\n\n---\n\nAny additional feedback is highly appreciated!\n\n\nIssue comments:\n\n\nFeature Context:\nFile: Troubleshooting.md\nLine number range: 1 - 329\nContent:\n1. # Troubleshooting Guide\n2. \n3. This guide describes how to troubleshoot common issues when using Gson.\n4. \n5. <!-- The \'<a id="..."></a>\' anchors below are used to create stable links; don\'t remove or rename them -->\n6. <!-- Use only lowercase IDs, GitHub seems to not support uppercase IDs, see also https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/50962 -->\n7. \n8. ## <a id="class-cast-exception"></a> `ClassCastException` when using deserialized object\n9. \n10. **Symptom:** `ClassCastException` is thrown when accessing an object deserialized by Gson\n11. \n12. **Reason:** Your code is most likely not type-safe\n13. \n14. **Solution:** Make sure your code adheres to the following:\n15. \n16. - Avoid raw types: Instead of calling `fromJson(..., List.class)`, create for example a `TypeToken<List<MyClass>>`.\n17.   See the [user guide](UserGuide.md#collections-examples) for more information.\n18. - When using `TypeToken` prefer the `Gson.fromJson` overloads with `TypeToken` parameter such as [`fromJson(Reader, TypeToken)`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/Gson.html#fromJson(java.io.Reader,com.google.gson.reflect.TypeToken)).\n19.   The overloads with `Type` parameter do not provide any type-safety guarantees.\n20. - When using `TypeToken` make sure you don\'t capture a type variable. For example avoid something like `new TypeToken<List<T>>()` (where `T` is a type variable). Due to Java type erasure the actual type of `T` is not available at runtime. Refactor your code to pass around `TypeToken` instances or use [`TypeToken.getParameterized(...)`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/reflect/TypeToken.html#getParameterized(java.lang.reflect.Type,java.lang.reflect.Type...)), for example `TypeToken.getParameterized(List.class, elementClass)`.\n21. \n22. ## <a id="reflection-inaccessible"></a> `InaccessibleObjectException`: \'module ... does not "opens ..." to unnamed module\'\n23. \n24. **Symptom:** An exception with a message in the form \'module ... does not "opens ..." to unnamed module\' is thrown\n25. \n26. **Reason:** You use Gson by accident to access internal fields of third-party classes\n27. \n28. **Solution:** Write custom Gson [`TypeAdapter`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html) implementations for the affected classes or change the type of your data. If this occurs for a field in one of your classes which you did not actually want to serialize or deserialize in the first place, you can exclude that field, see the [user guide](UserGuide.md#excluding-fields-from-serialization-and-deserialization).\n29. \n30. **Explanation:**\n31. \n32. When no built-in adapter for a type exists and no custom adapter has been registered, Gson falls back to using reflection to access the fields of a class (including `private` ones). Most likely you are seeing this error because you (by accident) rely on the reflection-based adapter for third-party classes. That should be avoided because you make yourself dependent on the implementation details of these classes which could change at any point. For the JDK it is also not possible anymore to access internal fields using reflection starting with JDK 17, see [JEP 403](https://openjdk.org/jeps/403).\n33. \n34. If you want to prevent using reflection on third-party classes in the future you can write your own [`ReflectionAccessFilter`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/ReflectionAccessFilter.html) or use one of the predefined ones, such as `ReflectionAccessFilter.BLOCK_ALL_PLATFORM`.\n35. \n36. ## <a id="reflection-inaccessible-to-module-gson"></a> `InaccessibleObjectException`: \'module ... does not "opens ..." to module com.google.gson\'\n37. \n38. **Symptom:** An exception with a message in the form \'module ... does not "opens ..." to module com.google.gson\' is thrown\n39. \n40. **Reason:**\n41. \n42. - If the reported package is your own package then you have not configured the module declaration of your project to allow Gson to use reflection on your classes.\n43. - If the reported package is from a third party library or the JDK see [this troubleshooting point](#inaccessibleobjectexception-module--does-not-opens--to-unnamed-module).\n44. \n45. **Solution:** Make sure the `module-info.java` file of your project allows Gson to use reflection on your classes, for example:\n46. \n47. ```java\n48. module mymodule {\n49.     requires com.google.gson;\n50. \n51.     opens mypackage to com.google.gson;\n52. }\n53. ```\n54. \n55. Or in case this occurs for a field in one of your classes which you did not actually want to serialize or deserialize in the first place, you can exclude that field, see the [user guide](UserGuide.md#excluding-fields-from-serialization-and-deserialization).\n56. \n57. ## <a id="android-app-random-names"></a> Android app not working in Release mode; random property names\n58. \n59. **Symptom:** Your Android app is working fine in Debug mode but fails in Release mode and the JSON properties have seemingly random names such as `a`, `b`, ...\n60. \n61. **Reason:** You probably have not configured ProGuard / R8 correctly\n62. \n63. **Solution:** Make sure you have configured ProGuard / R8 correctly to preserve the names of your fields. See the [Android example](examples/android-proguard-example/README.md) for more information.\n64. \n65. ## <a id="android-app-broken-after-app-update"></a> Android app unable to parse JSON after app update\n66. \n67. **Symptom:** You released a new version of your Android app and it fails to parse JSON data created by the previous version of your app\n68. \n69. **Reason:** You probably have not configured ProGuard / R8 correctly; probably the fields names are being obfuscated and their naming changed between the versions of your app\n70. \n71. **Solution:** Make sure you have configured ProGuard / R8 correctly to preserve the names of your fields. See the [Android example](examples/android-proguard-example/README.md) for more information.\n72. \n73. If you want to preserve backward compatibility for you app you can use [`@SerializedName`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/annotations/SerializedName.html) on the fields to specify the obfuscated name as alternate, for example: `@SerializedName(value = "myprop", alternate = "a")`\n74. \n75. Normally ProGuard and R8 produce a mapping file, this makes it easier to find out the obfuscated field names instead of having to find them out through trial and error or other means. See the [Android Studio user guide](https://developer.android.com/studio/build/shrink-code.html#retracing) for more information.\n76. \n77. ## <a id="default-field-values-missing"></a> Default field values not present after deserialization\n78. \n79. **Symptom:** You have assign default values to fields but after deserialization the fields have their standard value (such as `null` or `0`)\n80. \n81. **Reason:** Gson cannot invoke the constructor of your class and falls back to JDK `Unsafe` (or similar means)\n82. \n83. **Solution:** Make sure that the class:\n84. \n85. - is `static` (explicitly or implicitly when it is a top-level class)\n86. - has a no-args constructor\n87. \n88. Otherwise Gson will by default try to use JDK `Unsafe` or similar means to create an instance of your class without invoking the constructor and without running any initializers. You can also disable that behavior through [`GsonBuilder.disableJdkUnsafe()`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.html#disableJdkUnsafe()) to notice such issues early on.\n89. \n90. ## <a id="anonymous-local-null"></a> `null` values for anonymous and local classes\n91. \n92. **Symptom:** Objects of a class are always serialized as JSON `null` / always deserialized as Java `null`\n93. \n94. **Reason:** The class you are serializing or deserializing is an anonymous or a local class (or you have specified a custom `ExclusionStrategy`)\n95. \n96. **Solution:** Convert the class to a `static` nested class. If the class is already `static` make sure you have not specified a Gson `ExclusionStrategy` which might exclude the class.\n97. \n98. Notes:\n99. \n100. - "double brace-initialization" also creates anonymous classes\n101. - Local record classes (feature added in Java 16) are supported by Gson and are not affected by this\n102. \n103. ## <a id="map-key-wrong-json"></a> Map keys having unexpected format in JSON\n104. \n105. **Symptom:** JSON output for `Map` keys is unexpected / cannot be deserialized again\n106. \n107. **Reason:** The `Map` key type is \'complex\' and you have not configured the `GsonBuilder` properly\n108. \n109. **Solution:** Use [`GsonBuilder.enableComplexMapKeySerialization()`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.html#enableComplexMapKeySerialization()). See also the [user guide](UserGuide.md#maps-examples) for more information.\n110. \n111. ## <a id="malformed-json"></a> Parsing JSON fails with `MalformedJsonException`\n112. \n113. **Symptom:** JSON parsing fails with `MalformedJsonException`\n114. \n115. **Reason:** The JSON data is actually malformed\n116. \n117. **Solution:** During debugging, log the JSON data right before calling Gson methods or set a breakpoint to inspect the data and make sure it has the expected format. Sometimes APIs might return HTML error pages (instead of JSON data) when reaching rate limits or when other errors occur. Also read the location information of the `MalformedJsonException` exception message, it indicates where exactly in the document the malformed data was detected, including the [JSONPath](https://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/).\n118. \n119. For example, let\'s assume you want to deserialize the following JSON data:\n120. \n121. ```json\n122. {\n123.   "languages": [\n124.     "English",\n125.     "French",\n126.   ]\n127. }\n128. ```\n129. \n130. This will fail with an exception similar to this one: `MalformedJsonException: Use JsonReader.setLenient(true) to accept malformed JSON at line 5 column 4 path $.languages[2]`  \n131. The problem here is the trailing comma (`,`) after `"French"`, trailing commas are not allowed by the JSON specification. The location information "line 5 column 4" points to the `]` in the JSON data (with some slight inaccuracies) because Gson expected another value after `,` instead of the closing `]`. The JSONPath `$.languages[2]` in the exception message also points there: `$.` refers to the root object, `languages` refers to its member of that name and `[2]` refers to the (missing) third value in the JSON array value of that member (numbering starts at 0, so it is `[2]` instead of `[3]`).  \n132. The proper solution here is to fix the malformed JSON data.\n133. \n134. To spot syntax errors in the JSON data easily you can open it in an editor with support for JSON, for example Visual Studio Code. It will highlight within the JSON data the error location and show why the JSON data is considered invalid.\n135. \n136. ## <a id="number-parsed-as-double"></a> Integral JSON number is parsed as `double`\n137. \n138. **Symptom:** JSON data contains an integral number such as `45` but Gson returns it as `double`\n139. \n140. **Reason:** When parsing a JSON number as `Object`, Gson will by default create always return a `double`\n141. \n142. **Solution:** Use [`GsonBuilder.setObjectToNumberStrategy`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.html#setObjectToNumberStrategy(com.google.gson.ToNumberStrategy)) to specify what type of number should be returned\n143. \n144. ## <a id="default-lenient"></a> Malformed JSON not rejected\n145. \n146. **Symptom:** Gson parses malformed JSON without throwing any exceptions\n147. \n148. **Reason:** Due to legacy reasons Gson performs parsing by default in lenient mode\n149. \n150. **Solution:** See [`Gson` class documentation](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/Gson.html#default-lenient) section "Lenient JSON handling"\n151. \n152. Note: Even in non-lenient mode Gson deviates slightly from the JSON specification, see [`JsonReader.setLenient`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/stream/JsonReader.html#setLenient(boolean)) for more details.\n153. \n154. ## <a id="unexpected-json-structure"></a> `IllegalStateException`: "Expected ... but was ..."\n155. \n156. **Symptom:** An `IllegalStateException` with a message in the form "Expected ... but was ..." is thrown\n157. \n158. **Reason:** The JSON data does not have the correct format\n159. \n160. **Solution:** Make sure that your classes correctly model the JSON data. Also during debugging log the JSON data right before calling Gson methods or set a breakpoint to inspect the data and make sure it has the expected format. Read the location information of the exception message, it indicates where exactly in the document the error occurred, including the [JSONPath](https://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/).\n161. \n162. For example, let\'s assume you have the following Java class:\n163. \n164. ```java\n165. class WebPage {\n166.     String languages;\n167. }\n168. ```\n169. \n170. And you want to deserialize the following JSON data:\n171. \n172. ```json\n173. {\n174.   "languages": ["English", "French"]\n175. }\n176. ```\n177. \n178. This will fail with an exception similar to this one: `IllegalStateException: Expected a string but was BEGIN_ARRAY at line 2 column 17 path $.languages`  \n179. This means Gson expected a JSON string value but found the beginning of a JSON array (`[`). The location information "line 2 column 17" points to the `[` in the JSON data (with some slight inaccuracies), so does the JSONPath `$.languages` in the exception message. It refers to the `languages` member of the root object (`$.`).  \n180. The solution here is to change in the `WebPage` class the field `String languages` to `List<String> languages`.\n181. \n182. ## <a id="adapter-not-null-safe"></a> `IllegalStateException`: "Expected ... but was NULL"\n183. \n184. **Symptom:** An `IllegalStateException` with a message in the form "Expected ... but was NULL" is thrown\n185. \n186. **Reason:**\n187. \n188. - A built-in adapter does not support JSON null values\n189. - You have written a custom `TypeAdapter` which does not properly handle JSON null values\n190. \n191. **Solution:** If this occurs for a custom adapter you wrote, add code similar to the following at the beginning of its `read` method:\n192. \n193. ```java\n194. @Override\n195. public MyClass read(JsonReader in) throws IOException {\n196.     if (in.peek() == JsonToken.NULL) {\n197.         in.nextNull();\n198.         return null;\n199.     }\n200. \n201.     ...\n202. }\n203. ```\n204. \n205. Alternatively you can call [`nullSafe()`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html#nullSafe()) on the adapter instance you created.\n206. \n207. ## <a id="serialize-nulls"></a> Properties missing in JSON\n208. \n209. **Symptom:** Properties are missing in the JSON output\n210. \n211. **Reason:** Gson by default omits JSON null from the output (or: ProGuard / R8 is not configured correctly and removed unused fields)\n212. \n213. **Solution:** Use [`GsonBuilder.serializeNulls()`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.html#serializeNulls())\n214. \n215. Note: Gson does not support anonymous and local classes and will serialize them as JSON null, see the [related troubleshooting point](#null-values-for-anonymous-and-local-classes).\n216. \n217. ## <a id="android-internal-fields"></a> JSON output changes for newer Android versions\n218. \n219. **Symptom:** The JSON output differs when running on newer Android versions\n220. \n221. **Reason:** You use Gson by accident to access internal fields of Android classes\n222. \n223. **Solution:** Write custom Gson [`TypeAdapter`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html) implementations for the affected classes or change the type of your data\n224. \n225. **Explanation:**\n226. \n227. When no built-in adapter for a type exists and no custom adapter has been registered, Gson falls back to using reflection to access the fields of a class (including `private` ones). Most likely you are experiencing this issue because you (by accident) rely on the reflection-based adapter for Android classes. That should be avoided because you make yourself dependent on the implementation details of these classes which could change at any point.\n228. \n229. If you want to prevent using reflection on third-party classes in the future you can write your own [`ReflectionAccessFilter`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/ReflectionAccessFilter.html) or use one of the predefined ones, such as `ReflectionAccessFilter.BLOCK_ALL_PLATFORM`.\n230. \n231. ## <a id="json-static-fields"></a> JSON output contains values of `static` fields\n232. \n233. **Symptom:** The JSON output contains values of `static` fields\n234. \n235. **Reason:** You used `GsonBuilder.excludeFieldsWithModifiers` to overwrite the default excluded modifiers\n236. \n237. **Solution:** When calling `GsonBuilder.excludeFieldsWithModifiers` you overwrite the default excluded modifiers. Therefore, you have to explicitly exclude `static` fields if desired. This can be done by adding `Modifier.STATIC` as additional argument.\n238. \n239. ## <a id="no-such-method-error"></a> `NoSuchMethodError` when calling Gson methods\n240. \n241. **Symptom:** A `java.lang.NoSuchMethodError` is thrown when trying to call certain Gson methods\n242. \n243. **Reason:**\n244. \n245. - You have multiple versions of Gson on your classpath\n246. - Or, the Gson version you compiled against is different from the one on your classpath\n247. - Or, you are using a code shrinking tool such as ProGuard or R8 which removed methods from Gson\n248. \n249. **Solution:** First disable any code shrinking tools such as ProGuard or R8 and check if the issue persists. If not, you have to tweak the configuration of that tool to not modify Gson classes. Otherwise verify that the Gson JAR on your classpath is the same you are compiling against, and that there is only one Gson JAR on your classpath. See [this Stack Overflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/q/227486) to find out where a class is loaded from. For example, for debugging you could include the following code:\n250. \n251. ```java\n252. System.out.println(Gson.class.getProtectionDomain().getCodeSource().getLocation());\n253. ```\n254. \n255. If that fails with a `NullPointerException` you have to try one of the other ways to find out where a class is loaded from.\n256. \n257. ## <a id="duplicate-fields"></a> `IllegalArgumentException`: \'Class ... declares multiple JSON fields named \'...\'\'\n258. \n259. **Symptom:** An exception with the message \'Class ... declares multiple JSON fields named \'...\'\' is thrown\n260. \n261. **Reason:**\n262. \n263. - The name you have specified with a [`@SerializedName`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/annotations/SerializedName.html) annotation for a field collides with the name of another field\n264. - The [`FieldNamingStrategy`](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/FieldNamingStrategy.html) you have specified produces conflicting field names\n265. - A field of your class has the same name as the field of a superclass\n266. \n267. Gson prevents multiple fields with the same name because during deserialization it would be ambiguous for which field the JSON data should be deserialized. For serialization it would cause the same field to appear multiple times in JSON. While the JSON specification permits this, it is likely that the application parsing the JSON data will not handle it correctly.\n268. \n269. **Solution:** First identify the fields with conflicting names based on the exception message. Then decide if you want to rename one of them using the [`@SerializedName`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/annotations/SerializedName.html) annotation, or if you want to [exclude](UserGuide.md#excluding-fields-from-serialization-and-deserialization) one of them. When excluding one of the fields you have to include it for both serialization and deserialization (even if your application only performs one of these actions) because the duplicate field check cannot differentiate between these actions.\n270. \n271. ## <a id="java-lang-class-unsupported"></a> `UnsupportedOperationException` when serializing or deserializing `java.lang.Class`\n272. \n273. **Symptom:** An `UnsupportedOperationException` is thrown when trying to serialize or deserialize `java.lang.Class`\n274. \n275. **Reason:** Gson intentionally does not permit serializing and deserializing `java.lang.Class` for security reasons. Otherwise a malicious user could make your application load an arbitrary class from the classpath and, depending on what your application does with the `Class`, in the worst case perform a remote code execution attack.\n276. \n277. **Solution:** First check if you really need to serialize or deserialize a `Class`. Often it is possible to use string aliases and then map them to the known `Class`; you could write a custom [`TypeAdapter`](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html) to do this. If the `Class` values are not known in advance, try to introduce a common base class or interface for all these classes and then verify that the deserialized class is a subclass. For example assuming the base class is called `MyBaseClass`, your custom `TypeAdapter` should load the class like this:\n278. \n279. ```java\n280. Class.forName(jsonString, false, getClass().getClassLoader()).asSubclass(MyBaseClass.class)\n281. ```\n282. \n283. This will not initialize arbitrary classes, and it will throw a `ClassCastException` if the loaded class is not the same as or a subclass of `MyBaseClass`.\n284. \n285. ## <a id="type-token-raw"></a> `IllegalStateException`: \'TypeToken must be created with a type argument\' <br> `RuntimeException`: \'Missing type parameter\'\n286. \n287. **Symptom:** An `IllegalStateException` with the message \'TypeToken must be created with a type argument\' is thrown.  \n288. For older Gson versions a `RuntimeException` with message \'Missing type parameter\' is thrown.\n289. \n290. **Reason:**\n291. \n292. - You created a `TypeToken` without type argument, for example `new TypeToken() {}` (note the missing `<...>`). You always have to provide the type argument, for example like this: `new TypeToken<List<String>>() {}`. Normally the compiler will also emit a \'raw types\' warning when you forget the `<...>`.\n293. - You are using a code shrinking tool such as ProGuard or R8 (Android app builds normally have this enabled by default) but have not configured it correctly for usage with Gson.\n294. \n295. **Solution:** When you are using a code shrinking tool such as ProGuard or R8 you have to adjust your configuration to include the following rules:\n296. \n297. ```\n298. # Keep generic signatures; needed for correct type resolution\n299. -keepattributes Signature\n300. \n301. # Keep class TypeToken (respectively its generic signature)\n302. -keep class com.google.gson.reflect.TypeToken { *; }\n303. \n304. # Keep any (anonymous) classes extending TypeToken\n305. -keep class * extends com.google.gson.reflect.TypeToken\n306. ```\n307. \n308. See also the [Android example](examples/android-proguard-example/README.md) for more information.\n309. \n310. Note: For newer Gson versions these rules might be applied automatically; make sure you are using the latest Gson version and the latest version of the code shrinking tool.\n311. \n312. ## <a id="r8-abstract-class"></a> `JsonIOException`: \'Abstract classes can\'t be instantiated!\' (R8)\n313. \n314. **Symptom:** A `JsonIOException` with the message \'Abstract classes can\'t be instantiated!\' is thrown; the class mentioned in the exception message is not actually `abstract` in your source code, and you are using the code shrinking tool R8 (Android app builds normally have this configured by default).\n315. \n316. **Reason:** The code shrinking tool R8 performs optimizations where it removes the no-args constructor from a class and makes the class `abstract`. Due to this Gson cannot create an instance of the class.\n317. \n318. **Solution:** Make sure the class has a no-args constructor, then adjust your R8 configuration file to keep the constructor of the class. For example:\n319. \n320. ```\n321. # Keep the no-args constructor of the deserialized class\n322. -keepclassmembers class com.example.MyClass {\n323.   <init>();\n324. }\n325. ```\n326. \n327. For Android you can add this rule to the `proguard-rules.pro` file, see also the [Android documentation](https://developer.android.com/build/shrink-code#keep-code). In case the class name in the exception message is obfuscated, see the Android documentation about [retracing](https://developer.android.com/build/shrink-code#retracing).\n328. \n329. Note: If the class which you are trying to deserialize is actually abstract, then this exception is probably unrelated to R8 and you will have to implement a custom [`InstanceCreator`](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/InstanceCreator.html) or [`TypeAdapter`](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html) which creates an instance of a non-abstract subclass of the class.\n\n\nFile: examples/android-proguard-example/README.md\nLine number range: 1 - 17\nContent:\n1. # android-proguard-example\n2. \n3. Example Android project showing how to properly configure [ProGuard](https://www.guardsquare.com/proguard).\n4. ProGuard is a tool for \'shrinking\' and obfuscating compiled classes. It can rename methods and fields,\n5. or remove them if they appear to be unused. This can cause issues for Gson which uses Java reflection to\n6. access the fields of a class. It is necessary to configure ProGuard to make sure that Gson works correctly.\n7. \n8. Also have a look at the [ProGuard manual](https://www.guardsquare.com/manual/configuration/usage#keepoverview)\n9. and the [ProGuard Gson examples](https://www.guardsquare.com/manual/configuration/examples#gson) for more\n10. details on how ProGuard can be configured.\n11. \n12. The R8 code shrinker uses the same rule format as ProGuard, but there are differences between these two\n13. tools. Have a look at R8\'s Compatibility FAQ, and especially at the [Gson section](https://r8.googlesource.com/r8/+/refs/heads/main/compatibility-faq.md#gson).\n14. \n15. Note that newer Gson versions apply some of the rules shown in `proguard.cfg` automatically by default,\n16. see the file [`gson/META-INF/proguard/gson.pro`](/gson/src/main/resources/META-INF/proguard/gson.pro) for\n17. the Gson version you are using.\n\n\nFile: gson/src/main/java/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.java\nLine number range: 103 - 106\nContent:\n103.   private boolean generateNonExecutableJson = DEFAULT_JSON_NON_EXECUTABLE;\n104.   private boolean lenient = DEFAULT_LENIENT;\n105.   private boolean useJdkUnsafe = DEFAULT_USE_JDK_UNSAFE;\n106.   private ToNumberStrategy objectToNumberStrategy = DEFAULT_OBJECT_TO_NUMBER_STRATEGY;\n\n\nFile: gson/src/main/java/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.java\nLine number range: 756 - 760\nContent:\n756.   @CanIgnoreReturnValue\n757.   public GsonBuilder disableJdkUnsafe() {\n758.     this.useJdkUnsafe = false;\n759.     return this;\n760.   }\n\n\nFile: gson/src/main/java/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.java\nLine number range: 806 - 813\nContent:\n806.     return new Gson(excluder, fieldNamingPolicy, new HashMap<>(instanceCreators),\n807.         serializeNulls, complexMapKeySerialization,\n808.         generateNonExecutableJson, escapeHtmlChars, formattingStyle, lenient,\n809.         serializeSpecialFloatingPointValues, useJdkUnsafe, longSerializationPolicy,\n810.         datePattern, dateStyle, timeStyle, new ArrayList<>(this.factories),\n811.         new ArrayList<>(this.hierarchyFactories), factories,\n812.         objectToNumberStrategy, numberToNumberStrategy, new ArrayList<>(reflectionFilters));\n813.   }\n\n\nFile: gson/src/main/java/com/google/gson/JsonIOException.java\nLine number range: 16 - 45\nContent:\n16. package com.google.gson;\n17. \n18. /**\n19.  * This exception is raised when Gson was unable to read an input stream\n20.  * or write to one.\n21.  * \n22.  * @author Inderjeet Singh\n23.  * @author Joel Leitch\n24.  */\n25. public final class JsonIOException extends JsonParseException {\n26.   private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;\n27. \n28.   public JsonIOException(String msg) {\n29.     super(msg);\n30.   }\n31. \n32.   public JsonIOException(String msg, Throwable cause) {\n33.     super(msg, cause);\n34.   }\n35. \n36.   /**\n37.    * Creates exception with the specified cause.

Content: (duplicated for all Gson annotations)

But it looks like this is not enough, maybe because there is no `-keep` (or `-keepclasseswithmembers`) rule for the class in the first place so `-if` somehow has no effect? You additionally need the following (duplicated for all Gson annotations probably):

```
-keepclasseswithmembers class  { @com.google.gson.annotations.SerializedName ; } 
```

Only then the class is not made abstract and the constructor is properly kept... [...] (As side note: Having only the `-keepclasseswithmembers ... { @SerializedName }` above, but not the `-if ... -keep` seems to prevent R8 from making the class abstract, but still removes all constructors, so users would be dependent on JDK Unsafe then.)

Or similar to #2379 (comment) maybe the following would work as well:

```
-keepclasseswithmembers class  { (...); @com.google.gson.annotations.SerializedName ; } 
``` [...] There is however probably no need for the `-if` rule shown in the original comment, unless that has some special effect, see #2397 (comment).

### R8 makes class abstract but still keeps constructors

Title: proguard - android R8 how to keep class name but not members ...
URL: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/77253683/android-r8-how-to-keep-class-name-but-not-members
Content: If you want it for all classes (not just the ones used in the program) remove the second line `-if class `.

In the question only one field is annotated, and the above rules will only keep the annotated fields. If you want to keep all fields on classes where at least one field is annotated you will have to add the following rule as well:

```
# Keep all fields for classes which has at least one used field annotated with @ABC. -if class  { @ABC ; } -keep,allowobfuscation class <1> { ; } 
``` [...] Finally please note that as the class is a Kotlin class, the fields also have generated getters and setters, which are not kept by any of the rules above. There is unfortunately no generic way of keeping the getters and setters for exactly the fields which are kept. The following rule will keep all public getters and setters on classes where at least one field is annotated with `@ABC`:

```
-if class  { @ABC ; } -keep class <1> { public  get(); public void set(...); } 
``` [...] Add a comment   |

If you want to apply this to the classes which is actually used in your program you can use this rule:

```
# For all classes used in the program keep and obfuscate fields annotated with @ABC. -if class  -keepclasseswithmembers,allowobfuscation class <1> { @ABC ; } # Keep the class name for classes which has at least one used field annotated with @ABC. -if class  { @ABC ; } -keep class <1> 
```

The docs should caution about default value initializers being skipped when Unsafe is used.\n  - Matching classes “used with Gson” via default rules cannot be perfect; anchoring keep rules to presence of Gson annotations (SerializedName, Expose, JsonAdapter, Since, Until) is the most reliable low-cost heuristic.\n  - R8 behavior differs subtly from ProGuard; the suggested rule combinations must work under R8 as well.\n  - R8 can make classes abstract while still leaving constructors; exception-link behavior should still guide users to the Troubleshooting section in this case.\n\nArchitecture Analysis\n\n- Files to modify:\n  - gson/src/main/resources/META-INF/proguard/gson.pro\n    - Extend shipped default rules to:\n      - Preserve runtime annotations required by Gson.\n      - Keep constructors for classes that use Gson annotations, preventing R8’s abstract-class optimization and constructor stripping.\n  - Troubleshooting.md\n    - Update the “JsonIOException: ‘Abstract classes can’t be instantiated!’ (R8)” section to:\n      - Recommend keeping all constructors instead of only the no-args constructor.\n      - Explain why this matters for Kotlin classes.\n      - Suggest using @Keep (AndroidX) on classes or constructors as a simpler option.\n      - Clarify the interaction with JDK Unsafe and disableJdkUnsafe().\n    - Possibly update “Default field values not present after deserialization” to reinforce the Kotlin constructor situation and Unsafe caveats.\n  - examples/android-proguard-example/README.md\n    - Reflect the improved default rules shipped with Gson.\n    - Show guidance for annotation-based keeps and use of @Keep.\n    - Point to the gson.pro file and Troubleshooting section.\n  - gson/src/main/java/com/google/gson/internal/ConstructorConstructor.java\n    - Adjust abstract-class handling so exception messages always include a link to the Troubleshooting section even when R8 kept constructors but made the class abstract.\n- Integration:\n  - The updated gson.pro rules are automatically merged into consumer shrink configurations per existing behavior (as referenced by examples/docs).\n  - Exception messaging changes integrate with existing TroubleshootingGuide.createUrl and anchors already present in Troubleshooting.md.\n  - Documentation and example changes guide users who still need project-specific rules outside of what gson.pro can reliably cover.\n\nImplementation Plan\n\n1) Enhance default ProGuard/R8 rules\n- File: gson/src/main/resources/META-INF/proguard/gson.pro\n- Changes:\n  - Add a rule to keep runtime-visible annotations so Gson can read its annotations at runtime and so R8/ProGuard can match -if/-keepconditions on annotations reliably. Name the attribute explicitly for runtime-visible annotations. Keep generic signatures (already present in many setups, ensure it remains).\n  - Add annotation-conditional class rules to target only classes that are likely used with Gson:\n    - For classes with fields or types annotated with com.google.gson.annotations.SerializedName, Expose, Since, Until, and JsonAdapter:\n      - Add a rule that ensures these classes are not made abstract by R8 when such annotated members exist. Use the appropriate “keep classes with members” construct that matches members having these annotations.\n      - Add a companion rule that keeps all constructors (<init>(...)) for the matched classes, not just the no-args constructor. This guards against Kotlin primary constructor removal and avoids the abstract-class scenario caused by R8’s optimization.\n    - Ensure the combination of the “keep classes with members” and the “keep constructors for those classes” applies under R8. In practice under R8, the combination of the membership-matching rule and an -if followed by a keep-constructors rule is required to both prevent the class being made abstract and preserve constructors.\n  - Rationale:\n    - Preserving runtime annotations is required for Gson’s reflection and for shrinker annotation matching.\n    - Keeping all constructors for classes that use Gson annotations avoids the common Kotlin pitfall and prevents the abstract-class optimization in the first place.\n    - The rules are scoped to classes with Gson annotations to minimize over-keeping and preserve obfuscation/shrinking where possible.\n\n2) Improve Troubleshooting guidance\n- File: Troubleshooting.md\n- Sections to update:\n  - Section id: r8-abstract-class\n    - Replace the current recommendation to keep only the no-args constructor with guidance to keep all constructors for the affected class. Explain that Kotlin classes typically don’t have a no-args constructor and that keeping only a no-args constructor line is ineffective if such a constructor does not exist.\n    - Clarify whether to recommend -keep versus -keepclassmembers. Explain that when no-args constructor doesn’t exist, using a rule that keeps the class in addition to members can prevent R8 making it abstract, and that keeping all constructors more robustly prevents the abstract-class exception.\n    - Add an alternative for Android users: recommend using the Android @Keep annotation on the class or constructor to avoid manual ProGuard/R8 rule tweaking.\n    - Add a note about JDK Unsafe:\n      - If all constructors are removed or inaccessible, Gson may fall back to Unsafe (unless disabled), which will skip constructors and initializers; this causes missing default field values and other side effects.\n      - Mention disableJdkUnsafe() and its impact on failures and error messages.\n    - Expand the explanation for the case where the class is truly abstract in source: document that users should implement an InstanceCreator or TypeAdapter targeting a concrete subtype; ensure the section covers both the R8-induced abstract case and the genuine abstract class case.\n  - Optionally update “Default field values not present after deserialization”\n    - Add note that Kotlin classes with primary constructors and initialization logic rely on constructor execution; relying on Unsafe bypasses that and may yield default values missing, explaining why keeping constructors matters.\n\n3) Update example project documentation\n- File: examples/android-proguard-example/README.md\n- Changes:\n  - Reference that newer Gson versions ship expanded default rules that preserve annotations and constructors for classes using Gson annotations.\n  - Show guidance to:\n    - Use @Keep for Android as a simple alternative.\n    - For advanced setups, include per-class rules to keep all constructors when needed (described conceptually, not full config).\n  - Link to the Troubleshooting section for the abstract-class problem and retracing instructions.\n\n4) Include Troubleshooting link in exception for abstract classes regardless of constructor presence\n- File: gson/src/main/java/com/google/gson/internal/ConstructorConstructor.java\n- Changes:\n  - Method: checkInstantiable(Class<?> c)\n    - Adjust logic under Modifier.isAbstract(modifiers):\n      - Remove the condition that only includes a link if getDeclaredConstructors().length == 0.\n      - Always append the TroubleshootingGuide URL for r8-abstract-class to the exception message when class is abstract, so users are directed to the correct doc even for the scenario where R8 keeps constructors but makes the class abstract.\n    - Keep the differentiation in messaging: if the class is actually abstract in source, keep the general guidance to use InstanceCreator/TypeAdapter; the linked Troubleshooting section will cover both possibilities to avoid confusion.\n  - Impacted exception construction sites:\n    - The anonymous ObjectConstructor returned when exceptionMessage != null (lines 141–147) will now produce messages that consistently include the troubleshooting URL for abstract cases.\n\nConsiderations\n\n- Impacts on existing functionality:\n  - Default shrink rules will keep constructors of classes that have Gson annotations, potentially reducing maximum shrink/obfuscation for those classes. This is constrained to classes that opt-in via annotations, minimizing broad impact.\n  - Exception messages will change slightly to include a Troubleshooting link in more abstract-class scenarios, improving supportability. This is a non-breaking change.\n- Backward compatibility:\n  - Projects without Gson annotations will remain unaffected by the new default rules; they can continue to manage ProGuard/R8 rules themselves.\n  - The gson.pro rules are appended by the build system and remain overrideable by app-level proguard-rules.pro where needed.\n  - Documentation adjustments do not break API; they improve clarity for Kotlin and Android users.\n- Dependencies/prerequisites:\n  - Ensure gson.pro includes a directive to preserve runtime-visible annotations so that both Gson and R8/ProGuard matching on annotations function correctly.\n  - Confirm that the shipped rules are compatible with current R8 behavior. Testing the rules under typical Android Gradle Plugin versions is recommended before release (especially the interplay of -keepclasseswithmembers and -if conditions).\n  - No new runtime dependencies; @Keep is part of AndroidX and documented by Android; it is referenced as a recommended approach rather than required.\n\nWhy these changes implement the feature\n\n- By expanding gson.pro to keep constructors for classes using Gson annotations and preserving annotation attributes, we proactively mitigate the R8 optimization that leads to abstract-class instantiation failures. This aligns the default behavior with real-world Kotlin usage and lowers the burden on app developers.\n- Documentation changes give accurate, Kotlin-aware guidance and present @Keep as an easy Android solution, reducing the confusion around no-args constructor-only rules and Unsafe side effects.\n- The exception message change ensures users hit the Troubleshooting content even in edge cases where R8’s behavior diverges (abstract with constructors present), improving discoverability and resolution." additional_kwargs={'refusal': None} response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 4581, 'prompt_tokens': 15515, 'total_tokens': 20096, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'reasoning_tokens': 2432, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': 0, 'cached_tokens': 0}}, 'model_name': 'gpt-5-2025-08-07', 'system_fingerprint': None, 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None} id='run--ae285a96-82f5-45b8-bce2-bbc40f3d0744-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 15515, 'output_tokens': 4581, 'total_tokens': 20096, 'input_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'cache_read': 0}, 'output_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'reasoning': 2432}}

content='--- BEGIN ISSUE INFO ---\nIssue title:\nImprove default ProGuard / R8 rules and Troubleshooting Guide\n\nIssue description: \n# Problem solved by the feature\nImprove the default ProGuard / R8 rules in `META-INF/proguard/gson.pro` added by #2397, and the Troubleshooting Guide.\n\n# Feature description\nI was testing the new default rules with an Android app and Kotlin classes, and there might be the following areas to improve.\n\n### Troubleshooting Guide: `JsonIOException`: \'Abstract classes can\'t be instantiated!\' (R8)\n\nThe Troubleshooting Guide currently suggests the following:\n```\n# Keep the no-args constructor of the deserialized class\n-keepclassmembers class com.example.MyClass {\n  <init>();\n}\n```\n\nThis means only the no-args constructor is kept, but not any other constructors. However, especially for Kotlin I assume it is common that classes don\'t have a no-args constructor because you might declare properties and the primary constructor at once, e.g. `class MyClass(val s: String)` (see [Kotlin documentation](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/classes.html#constructors)). Not sure though if using that is a good idea in combination with Gson because it then requires JDK Unsafe to create instances, but that is a different topic.\n\nSo there are two questions:\n- Should the Troubleshooting Guide rather recommend `<init>(...);` (all constructors), so that the users don\'t experience issues with R8 anymore (but implicitly depend on JDK Unsafe; using `GsonBuilder.disableJdkUnsafe()` would cause Gson to fail with a different exception)\n- Should the Troubleshooting Guide recommend `-keep` instead of `-keepclassmembers`. In case the `<init>` rule for the class properly matches a constructor it might not matter. But in case `<init>();` is used, but a no-args constructor does not exist, then `-keep` seems to at least have the side-effect that R8 does not make the class abstract (and then using JDK Unsafe an instance can be created).\n\n### Troubleshooting Guide: Recommend `@Keep` for Android\nInstead of configuring ProGuard / R8 rules, it might be easier for Android developers to use `@Keep` on the corresponding class or constructor, see https://developer.android.com/studio/write/annotations#keep\n\n### Preventing R8 from making classes abstract / removing no-args constructor\n\nIt would be good if we could adjust the default rules to avoid the "Abstract classes can\'t be instantiated!" exception (for most cases) in the first place.\n\nThere is probably no general way to detect if a class might be used with Gson, but the most reliable variant might be to keep the constructor if any of the Gson annotations is used by a class.\n\nThis can probably be achieved with an [`-if` rule](https://www.guardsquare.com/manual/configuration/usage#if) (see also [answers to this Stack Overflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/q/63162818)). For example:\n```\n# If class has fields with `@SerializedName` annotation keep its constructors\n-if class * {\n  @com.google.gson.annotations.SerializedName <fields>;\n}\n-keep class <1> {\n  <init>(...);\n}\n```\n(duplicated for all Gson annotations)\n\nBut it looks like this is not enough, maybe because there is no `-keep` (or `-keepclasseswithmembers`) rule for the class in the first place so `-if` somehow has no effect? You additionally need the following (duplicated for all Gson annotations probably):\n```\n-keepclasseswithmembers class * {\n  @com.google.gson.annotations.SerializedName <fields>;\n}\n```\nOnly then the class is not made abstract and the constructor is properly kept...\n\n(As side note: Having only the `-keepclasseswithmembers ... { @SerializedName }` above, but not the `-if ... -keep` seems to prevent R8 from making the class abstract, but still removes all constructors, so users would be dependent on JDK Unsafe then.)\n\nOr similar to https://github.com/google/gson/issues/2379#issuecomment-1564517629 maybe the following would work as well:\n```\n-keepclasseswithmembers class * {\n  <init>(...);\n  @com.google.gson.annotations.SerializedName <fields>;\n}\n```\nThere is however probably no need for the `-if` rule shown in the original comment, unless that has some special effect, see https://github.com/google/gson/pull/2397#issuecomment-1575236086.\n\n### R8 makes class abstract but still keeps constructors\n\nIt also looks like the Android app build creates (for some reason) additional constructors / keeps constructors even when the class is made abstract. Due to this, the Troubleshooting Guide URLs are unfortunately not included in the exception messages (they are only added at the moment when there are no constructors).\nNot really sure why these constructors exist in the first place and are kept even when the class is made abstract. In the R8 integration test of Gson this behavior was not seen.\n\nMaybe we should remove the `getDeclaredConstructors().length == 0` check if the class is abstract and always refer to the Troubleshooting Guide. The guide would have to be adjusted then though to also properly cover the case where the class was indeed abstract in the source code.\n\n---\n\nAny additional feedback is highly appreciated!\n\n\nIssue comments:\n\n--- END ISSUE INFO ---\n\nContext Found:\n--- BEGIN CONTEXT ---\nFile: Troubleshooting.md\nLine number range: 1 - 329\nContent:\n1. # Troubleshooting Guide\n2. \n3. This guide describes how to troubleshoot common issues when using Gson.\n4. \n5. <!-- The \'<a id="..."></a>\' anchors below are used to create stable links; don\'t remove or rename them -->\n6. <!-- Use only lowercase IDs, GitHub seems to not support uppercase IDs, see also https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/50962 -->\n7. \n8. ## <a id="class-cast-exception"></a> `ClassCastException` when using deserialized object\n9. \n10. **Symptom:** `ClassCastException` is thrown when accessing an object deserialized by Gson\n11. \n12. **Reason:** Your code is most likely not type-safe\n13. \n14. **Solution:** Make sure your code adheres to the following:\n15. \n16. - Avoid raw types: Instead of calling `fromJson(..., List.class)`, create for example a `TypeToken<List<MyClass>>`.\n17.   See the [user guide](UserGuide.md#collections-examples) for more information.\n18. - When using `TypeToken` prefer the `Gson.fromJson` overloads with `TypeToken` parameter such as [`fromJson(Reader, TypeToken)`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/Gson.html#fromJson(java.io.Reader,com.google.gson.reflect.TypeToken)).\n19.   The overloads with `Type` parameter do not provide any type-safety guarantees.\n20. - When using `TypeToken` make sure you don\'t capture a type variable. For example avoid something like `new TypeToken<List<T>>()` (where `T` is a type variable). Due to Java type erasure the actual type of `T` is not available at runtime. Refactor your code to pass around `TypeToken` instances or use [`TypeToken.getParameterized(...)`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/reflect/TypeToken.html#getParameterized(java.lang.reflect.Type,java.lang.reflect.Type...)), for example `TypeToken.getParameterized(List.class, elementClass)`.\n21. \n22. ## <a id="reflection-inaccessible"></a> `InaccessibleObjectException`: \'module ... does not "opens ..." to unnamed module\'\n23. \n24. **Symptom:** An exception with a message in the form \'module ... does not "opens ..." to unnamed module\' is thrown\n25. \n26. **Reason:** You use Gson by accident to access internal fields of third-party classes\n27. \n28. **Solution:** Write custom Gson [`TypeAdapter`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html) implementations for the affected classes or change the type of your data. If this occurs for a field in one of your classes which you did not actually want to serialize or deserialize in the first place, you can exclude that field, see the [user guide](UserGuide.md#excluding-fields-from-serialization-and-deserialization).\n29. \n30. **Explanation:**\n31. \n32. When no built-in adapter for a type exists and no custom adapter has been registered, Gson falls back to using reflection to access the fields of a class (including `private` ones). Most likely you are seeing this error because you (by accident) rely on the reflection-based adapter for third-party classes. That should be avoided because you make yourself dependent on the implementation details of these classes which could change at any point. For the JDK it is also not possible anymore to access internal fields using reflection starting with JDK 17, see [JEP 403](https://openjdk.org/jeps/403).\n33. \n34. If you want to prevent using reflection on third-party classes in the future you can write your own [`ReflectionAccessFilter`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/ReflectionAccessFilter.html) or use one of the predefined ones, such as `ReflectionAccessFilter.BLOCK_ALL_PLATFORM`.\n35. \n36. ## <a id="reflection-inaccessible-to-module-gson"></a> `InaccessibleObjectException`: \'module ... does not "opens ..." to module com.google.gson\'\n37. \n38. **Symptom:** An exception with a message in the form \'module ... does not "opens ..." to module com.google.gson\' is thrown\n39. \n40. **Reason:**\n41. \n42. - If the reported package is your own package then you have not configured the module declaration of your project to allow Gson to use reflection on your classes.\n43. - If the reported package is from a third party library or the JDK see [this troubleshooting point](#inaccessibleobjectexception-module--does-not-opens--to-unnamed-module).\n44. \n45. **Solution:** Make sure the `module-info.java` file of your project allows Gson to use reflection on your classes, for example:\n46. \n47. ```java\n48. module mymodule {\n49.     requires com.google.gson;\n50. \n51.     opens mypackage to com.google.gson;\n52. }\n53. ```\n54. \n55. Or in case this occurs for a field in one of your classes which you did not actually want to serialize or deserialize in the first place, you can exclude that field, see the [user guide](UserGuide.md#excluding-fields-from-serialization-and-deserialization).\n56. \n57. ## <a id="android-app-random-names"></a> Android app not working in Release mode; random property names\n58. \n59. **Symptom:** Your Android app is working fine in Debug mode but fails in Release mode and the JSON properties have seemingly random names such as `a`, `b`, ...\n60. \n61. **Reason:** You probably have not configured ProGuard / R8 correctly\n62. \n63. **Solution:** Make sure you have configured ProGuard / R8 correctly to preserve the names of your fields. See the [Android example](examples/android-proguard-example/README.md) for more information.\n64. \n65. ## <a id="android-app-broken-after-app-update"></a> Android app unable to parse JSON after app update\n66. \n67. **Symptom:** You released a new version of your Android app and it fails to parse JSON data created by the previous version of your app\n68. \n69. **Reason:** You probably have not configured ProGuard / R8 correctly; probably the fields names are being obfuscated and their naming changed between the versions of your app\n70. \n71. **Solution:** Make sure you have configured ProGuard / R8 correctly to preserve the names of your fields. See the [Android example](examples/android-proguard-example/README.md) for more information.\n72. \n73. If you want to preserve backward compatibility for you app you can use [`@SerializedName`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/annotations/SerializedName.html) on the fields to specify the obfuscated name as alternate, for example: `@SerializedName(value = "myprop", alternate = "a")`\n74. \n75. Normally ProGuard and R8 produce a mapping file, this makes it easier to find out the obfuscated field names instead of having to find them out through trial and error or other means. See the [Android Studio user guide](https://developer.android.com/studio/build/shrink-code.html#retracing) for more information.\n76. \n77. ## <a id="default-field-values-missing"></a> Default field values not present after deserialization\n78. \n79. **Symptom:** You have assign default values to fields but after deserialization the fields have their standard value (such as `null` or `0`)\n80. \n81. **Reason:** Gson cannot invoke the constructor of your class and falls back to JDK `Unsafe` (or similar means)\n82. \n83. **Solution:** Make sure that the class:\n84. \n85. - is `static` (explicitly or implicitly when it is a top-level class)\n86. - has a no-args constructor\n87. \n88. Otherwise Gson will by default try to use JDK `Unsafe` or similar means to create an instance of your class without invoking the constructor and without running any initializers. You can also disable that behavior through [`GsonBuilder.disableJdkUnsafe()`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.html#disableJdkUnsafe()) to notice such issues early on.\n89. \n90. ## <a id="anonymous-local-null"></a> `null` values for anonymous and local classes\n91. \n92. **Symptom:** Objects of a class are always serialized as JSON `null` / always deserialized as Java `null`\n93. \n94. **Reason:** The class you are serializing or deserializing is an anonymous or a local class (or you have specified a custom `ExclusionStrategy`)\n95. \n96. **Solution:** Convert the class to a `static` nested class. If the class is already `static` make sure you have not specified a Gson `ExclusionStrategy` which might exclude the class.\n97. \n98. Notes:\n99. \n100. - "double brace-initialization" also creates anonymous classes\n101. - Local record classes (feature added in Java 16) are supported by Gson and are not affected by this\n102. \n103. ## <a id="map-key-wrong-json"></a> Map keys having unexpected format in JSON\n104. \n105. **Symptom:** JSON output for `Map` keys is unexpected / cannot be deserialized again\n106. \n107. **Reason:** The `Map` key type is \'complex\' and you have not configured the `GsonBuilder` properly\n108. \n109. **Solution:** Use [`GsonBuilder.enableComplexMapKeySerialization()`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.html#enableComplexMapKeySerialization()). See also the [user guide](UserGuide.md#maps-examples) for more information.\n110. \n111. ## <a id="malformed-json"></a> Parsing JSON fails with `MalformedJsonException`\n112. \n113. **Symptom:** JSON parsing fails with `MalformedJsonException`\n114. \n115. **Reason:** The JSON data is actually malformed\n116. \n117. **Solution:** During debugging, log the JSON data right before calling Gson methods or set a breakpoint to inspect the data and make sure it has the expected format. Sometimes APIs might return HTML error pages (instead of JSON data) when reaching rate limits or when other errors occur. Also read the location information of the `MalformedJsonException` exception message, it indicates where exactly in the document the malformed data was detected, including the [JSONPath](https://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/).\n118. \n119. For example, let\'s assume you want to deserialize the following JSON data:\n120. \n121. ```json\n122. {\n123.   "languages": [\n124.     "English",\n125.     "French",\n126.   ]\n127. }\n128. ```\n129. \n130. This will fail with an exception similar to this one: `MalformedJsonException: Use JsonReader.setLenient(true) to accept malformed JSON at line 5 column 4 path $.languages[2]`  \n131. The problem here is the trailing comma (`,`) after `"French"`, trailing commas are not allowed by the JSON specification. The location information "line 5 column 4" points to the `]` in the JSON data (with some slight inaccuracies) because Gson expected another value after `,` instead of the closing `]`. The JSONPath `$.languages[2]` in the exception message also points there: `$.` refers to the root object, `languages` refers to its member of that name and `[2]` refers to the (missing) third value in the JSON array value of that member (numbering starts at 0, so it is `[2]` instead of `[3]`).  \n132. The proper solution here is to fix the malformed JSON data.\n133. \n134. To spot syntax errors in the JSON data easily you can open it in an editor with support for JSON, for example Visual Studio Code. It will highlight within the JSON data the error location and show why the JSON data is considered invalid.\n135. \n136. ## <a id="number-parsed-as-double"></a> Integral JSON number is parsed as `double`\n137. \n138. **Symptom:** JSON data contains an integral number such as `45` but Gson returns it as `double`\n139. \n140. **Reason:** When parsing a JSON number as `Object`, Gson will by default create always return a `double`\n141. \n142. **Solution:** Use [`GsonBuilder.setObjectToNumberStrategy`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.html#setObjectToNumberStrategy(com.google.gson.ToNumberStrategy)) to specify what type of number should be returned\n143. \n144. ## <a id="default-lenient"></a> Malformed JSON not rejected\n145. \n146. **Symptom:** Gson parses malformed JSON without throwing any exceptions\n147. \n148. **Reason:** Due to legacy reasons Gson performs parsing by default in lenient mode\n149. \n150. **Solution:** See [`Gson` class documentation](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/Gson.html#default-lenient) section "Lenient JSON handling"\n151. \n152. Note: Even in non-lenient mode Gson deviates slightly from the JSON specification, see [`JsonReader.setLenient`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/stream/JsonReader.html#setLenient(boolean)) for more details.\n153. \n154. ## <a id="unexpected-json-structure"></a> `IllegalStateException`: "Expected ... but was ..."\n155. \n156. **Symptom:** An `IllegalStateException` with a message in the form "Expected ... but was ..." is thrown\n157. \n158. **Reason:** The JSON data does not have the correct format\n159. \n160. **Solution:** Make sure that your classes correctly model the JSON data. Also during debugging log the JSON data right before calling Gson methods or set a breakpoint to inspect the data and make sure it has the expected format. Read the location information of the exception message, it indicates where exactly in the document the error occurred, including the [JSONPath](https://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/).\n161. \n162. For example, let\'s assume you have the following Java class:\n163. \n164. ```java\n165. class WebPage {\n166.     String languages;\n167. }\n168. ```\n169. \n170. And you want to deserialize the following JSON data:\n171. \n172. ```json\n173. {\n174.   "languages": ["English", "French"]\n175. }\n176. ```\n177. \n178. This will fail with an exception similar to this one: `IllegalStateException: Expected a string but was BEGIN_ARRAY at line 2 column 17 path $.languages`  \n179. This means Gson expected a JSON string value but found the beginning of a JSON array (`[`). The location information "line 2 column 17" points to the `[` in the JSON data (with some slight inaccuracies), so does the JSONPath `$.languages` in the exception message. It refers to the `languages` member of the root object (`$.`).  \n180. The solution here is to change in the `WebPage` class the field `String languages` to `List<String> languages`.\n181. \n182. ## <a id="adapter-not-null-safe"></a> `IllegalStateException`: "Expected ... but was NULL"\n183. \n184. **Symptom:** An `IllegalStateException` with a message in the form "Expected ... but was NULL" is thrown\n185. \n186. **Reason:**\n187. \n188. - A built-in adapter does not support JSON null values\n189. - You have written a custom `TypeAdapter` which does not properly handle JSON null values\n190. \n191. **Solution:** If this occurs for a custom adapter you wrote, add code similar to the following at the beginning of its `read` method:\n192. \n193. ```java\n194. @Override\n195. public MyClass read(JsonReader in) throws IOException {\n196.     if (in.peek() == JsonToken.NULL) {\n197.         in.nextNull();\n198.         return null;\n199.     }\n200. \n201.     ...\n202. }\n203. ```\n204. \n205. Alternatively you can call [`nullSafe()`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html#nullSafe()) on the adapter instance you created.\n206. \n207. ## <a id="serialize-nulls"></a> Properties missing in JSON\n208. \n209. **Symptom:** Properties are missing in the JSON output\n210. \n211. **Reason:** Gson by default omits JSON null from the output (or: ProGuard / R8 is not configured correctly and removed unused fields)\n212. \n213. **Solution:** Use [`GsonBuilder.serializeNulls()`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.html#serializeNulls())\n214. \n215. Note: Gson does not support anonymous and local classes and will serialize them as JSON null, see the [related troubleshooting point](#null-values-for-anonymous-and-local-classes).\n216. \n217. ## <a id="android-internal-fields"></a> JSON output changes for newer Android versions\n218. \n219. **Symptom:** The JSON output differs when running on newer Android versions\n220. \n221. **Reason:** You use Gson by accident to access internal fields of Android classes\n222. \n223. **Solution:** Write custom Gson [`TypeAdapter`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html) implementations for the affected classes or change the type of your data\n224. \n225. **Explanation:**\n226. \n227. When no built-in adapter for a type exists and no custom adapter has been registered, Gson falls back to using reflection to access the fields of a class (including `private` ones). Most likely you are experiencing this issue because you (by accident) rely on the reflection-based adapter for Android classes. That should be avoided because you make yourself dependent on the implementation details of these classes which could change at any point.\n228. \n229. If you want to prevent using reflection on third-party classes in the future you can write your own [`ReflectionAccessFilter`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/ReflectionAccessFilter.html) or use one of the predefined ones, such as `ReflectionAccessFilter.BLOCK_ALL_PLATFORM`.\n230. \n231. ## <a id="json-static-fields"></a> JSON output contains values of `static` fields\n232. \n233. **Symptom:** The JSON output contains values of `static` fields\n234. \n235. **Reason:** You used `GsonBuilder.excludeFieldsWithModifiers` to overwrite the default excluded modifiers\n236. \n237. **Solution:** When calling `GsonBuilder.excludeFieldsWithModifiers` you overwrite the default excluded modifiers. Therefore, you have to explicitly exclude `static` fields if desired. This can be done by adding `Modifier.STATIC` as additional argument.\n238. \n239. ## <a id="no-such-method-error"></a> `NoSuchMethodError` when calling Gson methods\n240. \n241. **Symptom:** A `java.lang.NoSuchMethodError` is thrown when trying to call certain Gson methods\n242. \n243. **Reason:**\n244. \n245. - You have multiple versions of Gson on your classpath\n246. - Or, the Gson version you compiled against is different from the one on your classpath\n247. - Or, you are using a code shrinking tool such as ProGuard or R8 which removed methods from Gson\n248. \n249. **Solution:** First disable any code shrinking tools such as ProGuard or R8 and check if the issue persists. If not, you have to tweak the configuration of that tool to not modify Gson classes. Otherwise verify that the Gson JAR on your classpath is the same you are compiling against, and that there is only one Gson JAR on your classpath. See [this Stack Overflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/q/227486) to find out where a class is loaded from. For example, for debugging you could include the following code:\n250. \n251. ```java\n252. System.out.println(Gson.class.getProtectionDomain().getCodeSource().getLocation());\n253. ```\n254. \n255. If that fails with a `NullPointerException` you have to try one of the other ways to find out where a class is loaded from.\n256. \n257. ## <a id="duplicate-fields"></a> `IllegalArgumentException`: \'Class ... declares multiple JSON fields named \'...\'\'\n258. \n259. **Symptom:** An exception with the message \'Class ... declares multiple JSON fields named \'...\'\' is thrown\n260. \n261. **Reason:**\n262. \n263. - The name you have specified with a [`@SerializedName`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/annotations/SerializedName.html) annotation for a field collides with the name of another field\n264. - The [`FieldNamingStrategy`](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/FieldNamingStrategy.html) you have specified produces conflicting field names\n265. - A field of your class has the same name as the field of a superclass\n266. \n267. Gson prevents multiple fields with the same name because during deserialization it would be ambiguous for which field the JSON data should be deserialized. For serialization it would cause the same field to appear multiple times in JSON. While the JSON specification permits this, it is likely that the application parsing the JSON data will not handle it correctly.\n268. \n269. **Solution:** First identify the fields with conflicting names based on the exception message. Then decide if you want to rename one of them using the [`@SerializedName`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/annotations/SerializedName.html) annotation, or if you want to [exclude](UserGuide.md#excluding-fields-from-serialization-and-deserialization) one of them. When excluding one of the fields you have to include it for both serialization and deserialization (even if your application only performs one of these actions) because the duplicate field check cannot differentiate between these actions.\n270. \n271. ## <a id="java-lang-class-unsupported"></a> `UnsupportedOperationException` when serializing or deserializing `java.lang.Class`\n272. \n273. **Symptom:** An `UnsupportedOperationException` is thrown when trying to serialize or deserialize `java.lang.Class`\n274. \n275. **Reason:** Gson intentionally does not permit serializing and deserializing `java.lang.Class` for security reasons. Otherwise a malicious user could make your application load an arbitrary class from the classpath and, depending on what your application does with the `Class`, in the worst case perform a remote code execution attack.\n276. \n277. **Solution:** First check if you really need to serialize or deserialize a `Class`. Often it is possible to use string aliases and then map them to the known `Class`; you could write a custom [`TypeAdapter`](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html) to do this. If the `Class` values are not known in advance, try to introduce a common base class or interface for all these classes and then verify that the deserialized class is a subclass. For example assuming the base class is called `MyBaseClass`, your custom `TypeAdapter` should load the class like this:\n278. \n279. ```java\n280. Class.forName(jsonString, false, getClass().getClassLoader()).asSubclass(MyBaseClass.class)\n281. ```\n282. \n283. This will not initialize arbitrary classes, and it will throw a `ClassCastException` if the loaded class is not the same as or a subclass of `MyBaseClass`.\n284. \n285. ## <a id="type-token-raw"></a> `IllegalStateException`: \'TypeToken must be created with a type argument\' <br> `RuntimeException`: \'Missing type parameter\'\n286. \n287. **Symptom:** An `IllegalStateException` with the message \'TypeToken must be created with a type argument\' is thrown.  \n288. For older Gson versions a `RuntimeException` with message \'Missing type parameter\' is thrown.\n289. \n290. **Reason:**\n291. \n292. - You created a `TypeToken` without type argument, for example `new TypeToken() {}` (note the missing `<...>`). You always have to provide the type argument, for example like this: `new TypeToken<List<String>>() {}`. Normally the compiler will also emit a \'raw types\' warning when you forget the `<...>`.\n293. - You are using a code shrinking tool such as ProGuard or R8 (Android app builds normally have this enabled by default) but have not configured it correctly for usage with Gson.\n294. \n295. **Solution:** When you are using a code shrinking tool such as ProGuard or R8 you have to adjust your configuration to include the following rules:\n296. \n297. ```\n298. # Keep generic signatures; needed for correct type resolution\n299. -keepattributes Signature\n300. \n301. # Keep class TypeToken (respectively its generic signature)\n302. -keep class com.google.gson.reflect.TypeToken { *; }\n303. \n304. # Keep any (anonymous) classes extending TypeToken\n305. -keep class * extends com.google.gson.reflect.TypeToken\n306. ```\n307. \n308. See also the [Android example](examples/android-proguard-example/README.md) for more information.\n309. \n310. Note: For newer Gson versions these rules might be applied automatically; make sure you are using the latest Gson version and the latest version of the code shrinking tool.\n311. \n312. ## <a id="r8-abstract-class"></a> `JsonIOException`: \'Abstract classes can\'t be instantiated!\' (R8)\n313. \n314. **Symptom:** A `JsonIOException` with the message \'Abstract classes can\'t be instantiated!\' is thrown; the class mentioned in the exception message is not actually `abstract` in your source code, and you are using the code shrinking tool R8 (Android app builds normally have this configured by default).\n315. \n316. **Reason:** The code shrinking tool R8 performs optimizations where it removes the no-args constructor from a class and makes the class `abstract`. Due to this Gson cannot create an instance of the class.\n317. \n318. **Solution:** Make sure the class has a no-args constructor, then adjust your R8 configuration file to keep the constructor of the class. For example:\n319. \n320. ```\n321. # Keep the no-args constructor of the deserialized class\n322. -keepclassmembers class com.example.MyClass {\n323.   <init>();\n324. }\n325. ```\n326. \n327. For Android you can add this rule to the `proguard-rules.pro` file, see also the [Android documentation](https://developer.android.com/build/shrink-code#keep-code). In case the class name in the exception message is obfuscated, see the Android documentation about [retracing](https://developer.android.com/build/shrink-code#retracing).\n328. \n329. Note: If the class which you are trying to deserialize is actually abstract, then this exception is probably unrelated to R8 and you will have to implement a custom [`InstanceCreator`](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/InstanceCreator.html) or [`TypeAdapter`](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html) which creates an instance of a non-abstract subclass of the class.\n\n\nFile: examples/android-proguard-example/README.md\nLine number range: 1 - 17\nContent:\n1. # android-proguard-example\n2. \n3. Example Android project showing how to properly configure [ProGuard](https://www.guardsquare.com/proguard).\n4. ProGuard is a tool for \'shrinking\' and obfuscating compiled classes. It can rename methods and fields,\n5. or remove them if they appear to be unused. This can cause issues for Gson which uses Java reflection to\n6. access the fields of a class. It is necessary to configure ProGuard to make sure that Gson works correctly.\n7. \n8. Also have a look at the [ProGuard manual](https://www.guardsquare.com/manual/configuration/usage#keepoverview)\n9. and the [ProGuard Gson examples](https://www.guardsquare.com/manual/configuration/examples#gson) for more\n10. details on how ProGuard can be configured.\n11. \n12. The R8 code shrinker uses the same rule format as ProGuard, but there are differences between these two\n13. tools. Have a look at R8\'s Compatibility FAQ, and especially at the [Gson section](https://r8.googlesource.com/r8/+/refs/heads/main/compatibility-faq.md#gson).\n14. \n15. Note that newer Gson versions apply some of the rules shown in `proguard.cfg` automatically by default,\n16. see the file [`gson/META-INF/proguard/gson.pro`](/gson/src/main/resources/META-INF/proguard/gson.pro) for\n17. the Gson version you are using.\n\n\nFile: gson/src/main/java/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.java\nLine number range: 103 - 106\nContent:\n103.   private boolean generateNonExecutableJson = DEFAULT_JSON_NON_EXECUTABLE;\n104.   private boolean lenient = DEFAULT_LENIENT;\n105.   private boolean useJdkUnsafe = DEFAULT_USE_JDK_UNSAFE;\n106.   private ToNumberStrategy objectToNumberStrategy = DEFAULT_OBJECT_TO_NUMBER_STRATEGY;\n\n\nFile: gson/src/main/java/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.java\nLine number range: 756 - 760\nContent:\n756.   @CanIgnoreReturnValue\n757.   public GsonBuilder disableJdkUnsafe() {\n758.     this.useJdkUnsafe = false;\n759.     return this;\n760.   }\n\n\nFile: gson/src/main/java/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.java\nLine number range: 806 - 813\nContent:\n806.     return new Gson(excluder, fieldNamingPolicy, new HashMap<>(instanceCreators),\n807.         serializeNulls, complexMapKeySerialization,\n808.         generateNonExecutableJson, escapeHtmlChars, formattingStyle, lenient,\n809.         serializeSpecialFloatingPointValues, useJdkUnsafe, longSerializationPolicy,\n810.         datePattern, dateStyle, timeStyle, new ArrayList<>(this.factories),\n811.         new ArrayList<>(this.hierarchyFactories), factories,\n812.         objectToNumberStrategy, numberToNumberStrategy, new ArrayList<>(reflectionFilters));\n813.   }\n\n\nFile: gson/src/main/java/com/google/gson/JsonIOException.java\nLine number range: 16 - 45\nContent:\n16. package com.google.gson;\n17. \n18. /**\n19.  * This exception is raised when Gson was unable to read an input stream\n20.  * or write to one.\n21.  * \n22.  * @author Inderjeet Singh\n23.  * @author Joel Leitch\n24.  */\n25. public final class JsonIOException extends JsonParseException {\n26.   private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;\n27. \n28.   public JsonIOException(String msg) {\n29.     super(msg);\n30.   }\n31. \n32.   public JsonIOException(String msg, Throwable cause) {\n33.     super(msg, cause);\n34.   }\n35. \n36.   /**\n37.    * Creates exception with the specified cause.

Do NOT explore for more context in the codebase!\n\nAnalyzer agent has analyzed the issue and provided instruction on the issue:\n--- BEGIN ANALYZER MESSAGE ---\nFeature Understanding\n\n- Goal: Improve the default ProGuard/R8 rules shipped with the library (META-INF/proguard/gson.pro) so Android builds (especially Kotlin classes) avoid the common “Abstract classes can\'t be instantiated!” pitfalls introduced by R8 optimizations, and update the Troubleshooting Guide to give clearer, more effective guidance.\n- Requirements:\n  - Default rules should proactively prevent R8 from:\n    - Removing constructors that Gson requires to instantiate classes.\n    - Making classes abstract in cases where Gson expects to instantiate them.\n  - Documentation should:\n    - Recommend rules that match real-world Kotlin usage (primary constructors, no zero-arg constructor).\n    - Clarify when to keep all constructors vs. no-args constructor.\n    - Mention the Android @Keep annotation as a simpler alternative for developers.\n    - Explain interplay with JDK Unsafe and disableJdkUnsafe() to avoid confusing outcomes.\n  - Exception messages should consistently include Troubleshooting links in abstract-class scenarios, even when R8 keeps constructors but makes the class abstract, so users are guided to the correct section.\n- Ambiguities/Edge cases:\n  - Classes without no-args constructors (common in Kotlin) will push Gson to use Unsafe unless constructors are available and accessible. The docs should caution about default value initializers being skipped when Unsafe is used.\n  - Matching classes “used with Gson” via default rules cannot be perfect; anchoring keep rules to presence of Gson annotations (SerializedName, Expose, JsonAdapter, Since, Until) is the most reliable low-cost heuristic.\n  - R8 behavior differs subtly from ProGuard; the suggested rule combinations must work under R8 as well.\n  - R8 can make classes abstract while still leaving constructors; exception-link behavior should still guide users to the Troubleshooting section in this case.\n\nArchitecture Analysis\n\n- Files to modify:\n  - gson/src/main/resources/META-INF/proguard/gson.pro\n    - Extend shipped default rules to:\n      - Preserve runtime annotations required by Gson.\n      - Keep constructors for classes that use Gson annotations, preventing R8’s abstract-class optimization and constructor stripping.\n  - Troubleshooting.md\n    - Update the “JsonIOException: ‘Abstract classes can’t be instantiated!’ (R8)” section to:\n      - Recommend keeping all constructors instead of only the no-args constructor.\n      - Explain why this matters for Kotlin classes.\n      - Suggest using @Keep (AndroidX) on classes or constructors as a simpler option.\n      - Clarify the interaction with JDK Unsafe and disableJdkUnsafe().\n    - Possibly update “Default field values not present after deserialization” to reinforce the Kotlin constructor situation and Unsafe caveats.\n  - examples/android-proguard-example/README.md\n    - Reflect the improved default rules shipped with Gson.\n    - Show guidance for annotation-based keeps and use of @Keep.\n    - Point to the gson.pro file and Troubleshooting section.\n  - gson/src/main/java/com/google/gson/internal/ConstructorConstructor.java\n    - Adjust abstract-class handling so exception messages always include a link to the Troubleshooting section even when R8 kept constructors but made the class abstract.\n- Integration:\n  - The updated gson.pro rules are automatically merged into consumer shrink configurations per existing behavior (as referenced by examples/docs).\n  - Exception messaging changes integrate with existing TroubleshootingGuide.createUrl and anchors already present in Troubleshooting.md.\n  - Documentation and example changes guide users who still need project-specific rules outside of what gson.pro can reliably cover.\n\nImplementation Plan\n\n1) Enhance default ProGuard/R8 rules\n- File: gson/src/main/resources/META-INF/proguard/gson.pro\n- Changes:\n  - Add a rule to keep runtime-visible annotations so Gson can read its annotations at runtime and so R8/ProGuard can match -if/-keepconditions on annotations reliably. Name the attribute explicitly for runtime-visible annotations. Keep generic signatures (already present in many setups, ensure it remains).\n  - Add annotation-conditional class rules to target only classes that are likely used with Gson:\n    - For classes with fields or types annotated with com.google.gson.annotations.SerializedName, Expose, Since, Until, and JsonAdapter:\n      - Add a rule that ensures these classes are not made abstract by R8 when such annotated members exist. Use the appropriate “keep classes with members” construct that matches members having these annotations.\n      - Add a companion rule that keeps all constructors (<init>(...)) for the matched classes, not just the no-args constructor. This guards against Kotlin primary constructor removal and avoids the abstract-class scenario caused by R8’s optimization.\n    - Ensure the combination of the “keep classes with members” and the “keep constructors for those classes” applies under R8. In practice under R8, the combination of the membership-matching rule and an -if followed by a keep-constructors rule is required to both prevent the class being made abstract and preserve constructors.\n  - Rationale:\n    - Preserving runtime annotations is required for Gson’s reflection and for shrinker annotation matching.\n    - Keeping all constructors for classes that use Gson annotations avoids the common Kotlin pitfall and prevents the abstract-class optimization in the first place.\n    - The rules are scoped to classes with Gson annotations to minimize over-keeping and preserve obfuscation/shrinking where possible.\n\n2) Improve Troubleshooting guidance\n- File: Troubleshooting.md\n- Sections to update:\n  - Section id: r8-abstract-class\n    - Replace the current recommendation to keep only the no-args constructor with guidance to keep all constructors for the affected class. Explain that Kotlin classes typically don’t have a no-args constructor and that keeping only a no-args constructor line is ineffective if such a constructor does not exist.\n    - Clarify whether to recommend -keep versus -keepclassmembers. Explain that when no-args constructor doesn’t exist, using a rule that keeps the class in addition to members can prevent R8 making it abstract, and that keeping all constructors more robustly prevents the abstract-class exception.\n    - Add an alternative for Android users: recommend using the Android @Keep annotation on the class or constructor to avoid manual ProGuard/R8 rule tweaking.\n    - Add a note about JDK Unsafe:\n      - If all constructors are removed or inaccessible, Gson may fall back to Unsafe (unless disabled), which will skip constructors and initializers; this causes missing default field values and other side effects.\n      - Mention disableJdkUnsafe() and its impact on failures and error messages.\n    - Expand the explanation for the case where the class is truly abstract in source: document that users should implement an InstanceCreator or TypeAdapter targeting a concrete subtype; ensure the section covers both the R8-induced abstract case and the genuine abstract class case.\n  - Optionally update “Default field values not present after deserialization”\n    - Add note that Kotlin classes with primary constructors and initialization logic rely on constructor execution; relying on Unsafe bypasses that and may yield default values missing, explaining why keeping constructors matters.\n\n3) Update example project documentation\n- File: examples/android-proguard-example/README.md\n- Changes:\n  - Reference that newer Gson versions ship expanded default rules that preserve annotations and constructors for classes using Gson annotations.\n  - Show guidance to:\n    - Use @Keep for Android as a simple alternative.\n    - For advanced setups, include per-class rules to keep all constructors when needed (described conceptually, not full config).\n  - Link to the Troubleshooting section for the abstract-class problem and retracing instructions.\n\n4) Include Troubleshooting link in exception for abstract classes regardless of constructor presence\n- File: gson/src/main/java/com/google/gson/internal/ConstructorConstructor.java\n- Changes:\n  - Method: checkInstantiable(Class<?> c)\n    - Adjust logic under Modifier.isAbstract(modifiers):\n      - Remove the condition that only includes a link if getDeclaredConstructors().length == 0.\n      - Always append the TroubleshootingGuide URL for r8-abstract-class to the exception message when class is abstract, so users are directed to the correct doc even for the scenario where R8 keeps constructors but makes the class abstract.\n    - Keep the differentiation in messaging: if the class is actually abstract in source, keep the general guidance to use InstanceCreator/TypeAdapter; the linked Troubleshooting section will cover both possibilities to avoid confusion.\n  - Impacted exception construction sites:\n    - The anonymous ObjectConstructor returned when exceptionMessage != null (lines 141–147) will now produce messages that consistently include the troubleshooting URL for abstract cases.\n\nConsiderations\n\n- Impacts on existing functionality:\n  - Default shrink rules will keep constructors of classes that have Gson annotations, potentially reducing maximum shrink/obfuscation for those classes. This is constrained to classes that opt-in via annotations, minimizing broad impact.\n  - Exception messages will change slightly to include a Troubleshooting link in more abstract-class scenarios, improving supportability. This is a non-breaking change.\n- Backward compatibility:\n  - Projects without Gson annotations will remain unaffected by the new default rules; they can continue to manage ProGuard/R8 rules themselves.\n  - The gson.pro rules are appended by the build system and remain overrideable by app-level proguard-rules.pro where needed.\n  - Documentation adjustments do not break API; they improve clarity for Kotlin and Android users.\n- Dependencies/prerequisites:\n  - Ensure gson.pro includes a directive to preserve runtime-visible annotations so that both Gson and R8/ProGuard matching on annotations function correctly.\n  - Confirm that the shipped rules are compatible with current R8 behavior. Testing the rules under typical Android Gradle Plugin versions is recommended before release (especially the interplay of -keepclasseswithmembers and -if conditions).\n  - No new runtime dependencies; @Keep is part of AndroidX and documented by Android; it is referenced as a recommended approach rather than required.\n\nWhy these changes implement the feature\n\n- By expanding gson.pro to keep constructors for classes using Gson annotations and preserving annotation attributes, we proactively mitigate the R8 optimization that leads to abstract-class instantiation failures. This aligns the default behavior with real-world Kotlin usage and lowers the burden on app developers.\n- Documentation changes give accurate, Kotlin-aware guidance and present @Keep as an easy Android solution, reducing the confusion around no-args constructor-only rules and Unsafe side effects.\n- The exception message change ensures users hit the Troubleshooting content even in edge cases where R8’s behavior diverges (abstract with constructors present), improving discoverability and resolution.\n--- END ANALYZER MESSAGE ---\n\nIMPORTANT INSTRUCTION:\n- The context provided above should be sufficient for you to make the required code edits. Do NOT explore for more context in the codebase!\n- Do NOT FIND, WRITE or RUN any tests, your change will be tested automatically by reproduction tests and regression tests later!!!\n- Never write any tests yourself!!!

-# Troubleshooting Guide
-
-This guide describes how to troubleshoot common issues when using Gson.

-## <a id="class-cast-exception"></a> `ClassCastException` when using deserialized object
-
-**Symptom:** `ClassCastException` is thrown when accessing an object deserialized by Gson
-
-**Reason:** Your code is most likely not type-safe
-
-**Solution:** Make sure your code adheres to the following:
-
-- Avoid raw types: Instead of calling `fromJson(..., List.class)`, create for example a `TypeToken<List<MyClass>>`.
-  See the [user guide](UserGuide.md#collections-examples) for more information.
-- When using `TypeToken` prefer the `Gson.fromJson` overloads with `TypeToken` parameter such as [`fromJson(Reader, TypeToken)`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/Gson.html#fromJson(java.io.Reader,com.google.gson.reflect.TypeToken)).
-  The overloads with `Type` parameter do not provide any type-safety guarantees.
-- When using `TypeToken` make sure you don't capture a type variable. For example avoid something like `new TypeToken<List<T>>()` (where `T` is a type variable). Due to Java type erasure the actual type of `T` is not available at runtime. Refactor your code to pass around `TypeToken` instances or use [`TypeToken.getParameterized(...)`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/reflect/TypeToken.html#getParameterized(java.lang.reflect.Type,java.lang.reflect.Type...)), for example `TypeToken.getParameterized(List.class, elementClass)`.
-
-## <a id="reflection-inaccessible"></a> `InaccessibleObjectException`: 'module ... does not "opens ..." to unnamed module'
-
-**Symptom:** An exception with a message in the form 'module ... does not "opens ..." to unnamed module' is thrown
-
-**Reason:** You use Gson by accident to access internal fields of third-party classes
-
-**Solution:** Write custom Gson [`TypeAdapter`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html) implementations for the affected classes or change the type of your data. If this occurs for a field in one of your classes which you did not actually want to serialize or deserialize in the first place, you can exclude that field, see the [user guide](UserGuide.md#excluding-fields-from-serialization-and-deserialization).
-
-**Explanation:**
-
-When no built-in adapter for a type exists and no custom adapter has been registered, Gson falls back to using reflection to access the fields of a class (including `private` ones). Most likely you are seeing this error because you (by accident) rely on the reflection-based adapter for third-party classes. That should be avoided because you make yourself dependent on the implementation details of these classes which could change at any point. For the JDK it is also not possible anymore to access internal fields using reflection starting with JDK 17, see [JEP 403](https://openjdk.org/jeps/403).
-
-If you want to prevent using reflection on third-party classes in the future you can write your own [`ReflectionAccessFilter`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/ReflectionAccessFilter.html) or use one of the predefined ones, such as `ReflectionAccessFilter.BLOCK_ALL_PLATFORM`.
-
-## <a id="reflection-inaccessible-to-module-gson"></a> `InaccessibleObjectException`: 'module ... does not "opens ..." to module com.google.gson'
-
-**Symptom:** An exception with a message in the form 'module ... does not "opens ..." to module com.google.gson' is thrown
-
-**Reason:**
-
-- If the reported package is your own package then you have not configured the module declaration of your project to allow Gson to use reflection on your classes.
-- If the reported package is from a third party library or the JDK see [this troubleshooting point](#inaccessibleobjectexception-module--does-not-opens--to-unnamed-module).
-
-**Solution:** Make sure the `module-info.java` file of your project allows Gson to use reflection on your classes, for example:
-
-```java
-module mymodule {
-    requires com.google.gson;
-
-    opens mypackage to com.google.gson;
-}
-```
-
-Or in case this occurs for a field in one of your classes which you did not actually want to serialize or deserialize in the first place, you can exclude that field, see the [user guide](UserGuide.md#excluding-fields-from-serialization-and-deserialization).
-
-## <a id="android-app-random-names"></a> Android app not working in Release mode; random property names
-
-**Symptom:** Your Android app is working fine in Debug mode but fails in Release mode and the JSON properties have seemingly random names such as `a`, `b`, ...
-
-**Reason:** You probably have not configured ProGuard / R8 correctly
-
-**Solution:** Make sure you have configured ProGuard / R8 correctly to preserve the names of your fields. See the [Android example](examples/android-proguard-example/README.md) for more information.
-
-## <a id="android-app-broken-after-app-update"></a> Android app unable to parse JSON after app update
-
-**Symptom:** You released a new version of your Android app and it fails to parse JSON data created by the previous version of your app
-
-**Reason:** You probably have not configured ProGuard / R8 correctly; probably the fields names are being obfuscated and their naming changed between the versions of your app
-
-**Solution:** Make sure you have configured ProGuard / R8 correctly to preserve the names of your fields. See the [Android example](examples/android-proguard-example/README.md) for more information.
-
-If you want to preserve backward compatibility for you app you can use [`@SerializedName`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/annotations/SerializedName.html) on the fields to specify the obfuscated name as alternate, for example: `@SerializedName(value = "myprop", alternate = "a")`
-
-Normally ProGuard and R8 produce a mapping file, this makes it easier to find out the obfuscated field names instead of having to find them out through trial and error or other means. See the [Android Studio user guide](https://developer.android.com/studio/build/shrink-code.html#retracing) for more information.
-
-## <a id="default-field-values-missing"></a> Default field values not present after deserialization
-
-**Symptom:** You have assign default values to fields but after deserialization the fields have their standard value (such as `null` or `0`)
-
-**Reason:** Gson cannot invoke the constructor of your class and falls back to JDK `Unsafe` (or similar means)
-
-**Solution:** Make sure that the class:
-
-- is `static` (explicitly or implicitly when it is a top-level class)
-- has a no-args constructor
-
-Otherwise Gson will by default try to use JDK `Unsafe` or similar means to create an instance of your class without invoking the constructor and without running any initializers. You can also disable that behavior through [`GsonBuilder.disableJdkUnsafe()`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.html#disableJdkUnsafe()) to notice such issues early on.
-
-## <a id="anonymous-local-null"></a> `null` values for anonymous and local classes
-
-**Symptom:** Objects of a class are always serialized as JSON `null` / always deserialized as Java `null`
-
-**Reason:** The class you are serializing or deserializing is an anonymous or a local class (or you have specified a custom `ExclusionStrategy`)
-
-**Solution:** Convert the class to a `static` nested class. If the class is already `static` make sure you have not specified a Gson `ExclusionStrategy` which might exclude the class.
-
-Notes:
-
-- "double brace-initialization" also creates anonymous classes
-- Local record classes (feature added in Java 16) are supported by Gson and are not affected by this
-
-## <a id="map-key-wrong-json"></a> Map keys having unexpected format in JSON
-
-**Symptom:** JSON output for `Map` keys is unexpected / cannot be deserialized again
-
-**Reason:** The `Map` key type is 'complex' and you have not configured the `GsonBuilder` properly
-
-**Solution:** Use [`GsonBuilder.enableComplexMapKeySerialization()`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.html#enableComplexMapKeySerialization()). See also the [user guide](UserGuide.md#maps-examples) for more information.
-
-## <a id="malformed-json"></a> Parsing JSON fails with `MalformedJsonException`
-
-**Symptom:** JSON parsing fails with `MalformedJsonException`
-
-**Reason:** The JSON data is actually malformed
-
-**Solution:** During debugging, log the JSON data right before calling Gson methods or set a breakpoint to inspect the data and make sure it has the expected format. Sometimes APIs might return HTML error pages (instead of JSON data) when reaching rate limits or when other errors occur. Also read the location information of the `MalformedJsonException` exception message, it indicates where exactly in the document the malformed data was detected, including the [JSONPath](https://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/).
-
-For example, let's assume you want to deserialize the following JSON data:
-
-```json
-{
-  "languages": [
-    "English",
-    "French",
-  ]
-}
-```
-
-This will fail with an exception similar to this one: `MalformedJsonException: Use JsonReader.setLenient(true) to accept malformed JSON at line 5 column 4 path $.languages[2]`  
-The problem here is the trailing comma (`,`) after `"French"`, trailing commas are not allowed by the JSON specification. The location information "line 5 column 4" points to the `]` in the JSON data (with some slight inaccuracies) because Gson expected another value after `,` instead of the closing `]`. The JSONPath `$.languages[2]` in the exception message also points there: `$.` refers to the root object, `languages` refers to its member of that name and `[2]` refers to the (missing) third value in the JSON array value of that member (numbering starts at 0, so it is `[2]` instead of `[3]`).  
-The proper solution here is to fix the malformed JSON data.
-
-To spot syntax errors in the JSON data easily you can open it in an editor with support for JSON, for example Visual Studio Code. It will highlight within the JSON data the error location and show why the JSON data is considered invalid.
-
-## <a id="number-parsed-as-double"></a> Integral JSON number is parsed as `double`
-
-**Symptom:** JSON data contains an integral number such as `45` but Gson returns it as `double`
-
-**Reason:** When parsing a JSON number as `Object`, Gson will by default create always return a `double`
-
-**Solution:** Use [`GsonBuilder.setObjectToNumberStrategy`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.html#setObjectToNumberStrategy(com.google.gson.ToNumberStrategy)) to specify what type of number should be returned
-
-## <a id="default-lenient"></a> Malformed JSON not rejected
-
-**Symptom:** Gson parses malformed JSON without throwing any exceptions
-
-**Reason:** Due to legacy reasons Gson performs parsing by default in lenient mode
-
-**Solution:** See [`Gson` class documentation](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/Gson.html#default-lenient) section "Lenient JSON handling"
-
-Note: Even in non-lenient mode Gson deviates slightly from the JSON specification, see [`JsonReader.setLenient`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/stream/JsonReader.html#setLenient(boolean)) for more details.
-
-## <a id="unexpected-json-structure"></a> `IllegalStateException`: "Expected ... but was ..."
-
-**Symptom:** An `IllegalStateException` with a message in the form "Expected ... but was ..." is thrown
-
-**Reason:** The JSON data does not have the correct format
-
-**Solution:** Make sure that your classes correctly model the JSON data. Also during debugging log the JSON data right before calling Gson methods or set a breakpoint to inspect the data and make sure it has the expected format. Read the location information of the exception message, it indicates where exactly in the document the error occurred, including the [JSONPath](https://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/).
-
-For example, let's assume you have the following Java class:
-
-```java
-class WebPage {
-    String languages;
-}
-```
-
-And you want to deserialize the following JSON data:
-
-```json
-{
-  "languages": ["English", "French"]
-}
-```
-
-This will fail with an exception similar to this one: `IllegalStateException: Expected a string but was BEGIN_ARRAY at line 2 column 17 path $.languages`  
-This means Gson expected a JSON string value but found the beginning of a JSON array (`[`). The location information "line 2 column 17" points to the `[` in the JSON data (with some slight inaccuracies), so does the JSONPath `$.languages` in the exception message. It refers to the `languages` member of the root object (`$.`).  
-The solution here is to change in the `WebPage` class the field `String languages` to `List<String> languages`.
-
-## <a id="adapter-not-null-safe"></a> `IllegalStateException`: "Expected ... but was NULL"
-
-**Symptom:** An `IllegalStateException` with a message in the form "Expected ... but was NULL" is thrown
-
-**Reason:**
-
-- A built-in adapter does not support JSON null values
-- You have written a custom `TypeAdapter` which does not properly handle JSON null values
-
-**Solution:** If this occurs for a custom adapter you wrote, add code similar to the following at the beginning of its `read` method:
-
-```java
-@Override
-public MyClass read(JsonReader in) throws IOException {
-    if (in.peek() == JsonToken.NULL) {
-        in.nextNull();
-        return null;
-    }
-
-    ...
-}
-```
-
-Alternatively you can call [`nullSafe()`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html#nullSafe()) on the adapter instance you created.
-
-## <a id="serialize-nulls"></a> Properties missing in JSON
-
-**Symptom:** Properties are missing in the JSON output
-
-**Reason:** Gson by default omits JSON null from the output (or: ProGuard / R8 is not configured correctly and removed unused fields)
-
-**Solution:** Use [`GsonBuilder.serializeNulls()`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.html#serializeNulls())
-
-Note: Gson does not support anonymous and local classes and will serialize them as JSON null, see the [related troubleshooting point](#null-values-for-anonymous-and-local-classes).
-
-## <a id="android-internal-fields"></a> JSON output changes for newer Android versions
-
-**Symptom:** The JSON output differs when running on newer Android versions
-
-**Reason:** You use Gson by accident to access internal fields of Android classes
-
-**Solution:** Write custom Gson [`TypeAdapter`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html) implementations for the affected classes or change the type of your data
-
-**Explanation:**
-
-When no built-in adapter for a type exists and no custom adapter has been registered, Gson falls back to using reflection to access the fields of a class (including `private` ones). Most likely you are experiencing this issue because you (by accident) rely on the reflection-based adapter for Android classes. That should be avoided because you make yourself dependent on the implementation details of these classes which could change at any point.
-
-If you want to prevent using reflection on third-party classes in the future you can write your own [`ReflectionAccessFilter`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/ReflectionAccessFilter.html) or use one of the predefined ones, such as `ReflectionAccessFilter.BLOCK_ALL_PLATFORM`.
-
-## <a id="json-static-fields"></a> JSON output contains values of `static` fields
-
-**Symptom:** The JSON output contains values of `static` fields
-
-**Reason:** You used `GsonBuilder.excludeFieldsWithModifiers` to overwrite the default excluded modifiers
-
-**Solution:** When calling `GsonBuilder.excludeFieldsWithModifiers` you overwrite the default excluded modifiers. Therefore, you have to explicitly exclude `static` fields if desired. This can be done by adding `Modifier.STATIC` as additional argument.
-
-## <a id="no-such-method-error"></a> `NoSuchMethodError` when calling Gson methods
-
-**Symptom:** A `java.lang.NoSuchMethodError` is thrown when trying to call certain Gson methods
-
-**Reason:**
-
-- You have multiple versions of Gson on your classpath
-- Or, the Gson version you compiled against is different from the one on your classpath
-- Or, you are using a code shrinking tool such as ProGuard or R8 which removed methods from Gson
-
-**Solution:** First disable any code shrinking tools such as ProGuard or R8 and check if the issue persists. If not, you have to tweak the configuration of that tool to not modify Gson classes. Otherwise verify that the Gson JAR on your classpath is the same you are compiling against, and that there is only one Gson JAR on your classpath. See [this Stack Overflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/q/227486) to find out where a class is loaded from. For example, for debugging you could include the following code:
-
-```java
-System.out.println(Gson.class.getProtectionDomain().getCodeSource().getLocation());
-```
-
-If that fails with a `NullPointerException` you have to try one of the other ways to find out where a class is loaded from.
-
-## <a id="duplicate-fields"></a> `IllegalArgumentException`: 'Class ... declares multiple JSON fields named '...''
-
-**Symptom:** An exception with the message 'Class ... declares multiple JSON fields named '...'' is thrown
-
-**Reason:**
-
-- The name you have specified with a [`@SerializedName`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/annotations/SerializedName.html) annotation for a field collides with the name of another field
-- The [`FieldNamingStrategy`](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/FieldNamingStrategy.html) you have specified produces conflicting field names
-- A field of your class has the same name as the field of a superclass
-
-Gson prevents multiple fields with the same name because during deserialization it would be ambiguous for which field the JSON data should be deserialized. For serialization it would cause the same field to appear multiple times in JSON. While the JSON specification permits this, it is likely that the application parsing the JSON data will not handle it correctly.
-
-**Solution:** First identify the fields with conflicting names based on the exception message. Then decide if you want to rename one of them using the [`@SerializedName`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/annotations/SerializedName.html) annotation, or if you want to [exclude](UserGuide.md#excluding-fields-from-serialization-and-deserialization) one of them. When excluding one of the fields you have to include it for both serialization and deserialization (even if your application only performs one of these actions) because the duplicate field check cannot differentiate between these actions.
-
-## <a id="java-lang-class-unsupported"></a> `UnsupportedOperationException` when serializing or deserializing `java.lang.Class`
-
-**Symptom:** An `UnsupportedOperationException` is thrown when trying to serialize or deserialize `java.lang.Class`
-
-**Reason:** Gson intentionally does not permit serializing and deserializing `java.lang.Class` for security reasons. Otherwise a malicious user could make your application load an arbitrary class from the classpath and, depending on what your application does with the `Class`, in the worst case perform a remote code execution attack.
-
-**Solution:** First check if you really need to serialize or deserialize a `Class`. Often it is possible to use string aliases and then map them to the known `Class`; you could write a custom [`TypeAdapter`](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html) to do this. If the `Class` values are not known in advance, try to introduce a common base class or interface for all these classes and then verify that the deserialized class is a subclass. For example assuming the base class is called `MyBaseClass`, your custom `TypeAdapter` should load the class like this:
-
-```java
-Class.forName(jsonString, false, getClass().getClassLoader()).asSubclass(MyBaseClass.class)
-```
-
-This will not initialize arbitrary classes, and it will throw a `ClassCastException` if the loaded class is not the same as or a subclass of `MyBaseClass`.
-
-## <a id="type-token-raw"></a> `IllegalStateException`: 'TypeToken must be created with a type argument' <br> `RuntimeException`: 'Missing type parameter'
-
-**Symptom:** An `IllegalStateException` with the message 'TypeToken must be created with a type argument' is thrown.  
-For older Gson versions a `RuntimeException` with message 'Missing type parameter' is thrown.
-
-**Reason:**
-
-- You created a `TypeToken` without type argument, for example `new TypeToken() {}` (note the missing `<...>`). You always have to provide the type argument, for example like this: `new TypeToken<List<String>>() {}`. Normally the compiler will also emit a 'raw types' warning when you forget the `<...>`.
-- You are using a code shrinking tool such as ProGuard or R8 (Android app builds normally have this enabled by default) but have not configured it correctly for usage with Gson.
-
-**Solution:** When you are using a code shrinking tool such as ProGuard or R8 you have to adjust your configuration to include the following rules:
-
-```
-# Keep generic signatures; needed for correct type resolution
--keepattributes Signature
-
-# Keep class TypeToken (respectively its generic signature)
--keep class com.google.gson.reflect.TypeToken { *; }
-
-# Keep any (anonymous) classes extending TypeToken
--keep class * extends com.google.gson.reflect.TypeToken
-```
-
-See also the [Android example](examples/android-proguard-example/README.md) for more information.
-
-Note: For newer Gson versions these rules might be applied automatically; make sure you are using the latest Gson version and the latest version of the code shrinking tool.
-
-## <a id="r8-abstract-class"></a> `JsonIOException`: 'Abstract classes can't be instantiated!' (R8)
-
-**Symptom:** A `JsonIOException` with the message 'Abstract classes can't be instantiated!' is thrown; the class mentioned in the exception message is not actually `abstract` in your source code, and you are using the code shrinking tool R8 (Android app builds normally have this configured by default).
-
-**Reason:** The code shrinking tool R8 performs optimizations where it removes the no-args constructor from a class and makes the class `abstract`. Due to this Gson cannot create an instance of the class.
-
-**Solution:** Make sure the class has a no-args constructor, then adjust your R8 configuration file to keep the constructor of the class. For example:
-
-```
-# Keep the no-args constructor of the deserialized class
--keepclassmembers class com.example.MyClass {
-  <init>();
-}
-```
-
-For Android you can add this rule to the `proguard-rules.pro` file, see also the [Android documentation](https://developer.android.com/build/shrink-code#keep-code). In case the class name in the exception message is obfuscated, see the Android documentation about [retracing](https://developer.android.com/build/shrink-code#retracing).
-
-Note: If the class which you are trying to deserialize is actually abstract, then this exception is probably unrelated to R8 and you will have to implement a custom [`InstanceCreator`](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/InstanceCreator.html) or [`TypeAdapter`](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html) which creates an instance of a non-abstract subclass of the class.

+
+## <a id="class-cast-exception"></a> `ClassCastException` when using deserialized object
+
+**Symptom:** `ClassCastException` is thrown when accessing an object deserialized by Gson
+
+**Reason:** Your code is most likely not type-safe
+
+**Solution:** Make sure your code adheres to the following:
+
+- Avoid raw types: Instead of calling `fromJson(..., List.class)`, create for example a `TypeToken<List<MyClass>>`.
+  See the [user guide](UserGuide.md#collections-examples) for more information.
+- When using `TypeToken` prefer the `Gson.fromJson` overloads with `TypeToken` parameter such as [`fromJson(Reader, TypeToken)`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/Gson.html#fromJson(java.io.Reader,com.google.gson.reflect.TypeToken)).
+  The overloads with `Type` parameter do not provide any type-safety guarantees.
+- When using `TypeToken` make sure you don't capture a type variable. For example avoid something like `new TypeToken<List<T>>()` (where `T` is a type variable). Due to Java type erasure the actual type of `T` is not available at runtime. Refactor your code to pass around `TypeToken` instances or use [`TypeToken.getParameterized(...)`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/reflect/TypeToken.html#getParameterized(java.lang.reflect.Type,java.lang.reflect.Type...)), for example `TypeToken.getParameterized(List.class, elementClass)`.
+
+## <a id="reflection-inaccessible"></a> `InaccessibleObjectException`: 'module ... does not "opens ..." to unnamed module'
+
+**Symptom:** An exception with a message in the form 'module ... does not "opens ..." to unnamed module' is thrown
+
+**Reason:** You use Gson by accident to access internal fields of third-party classes
+
+**Solution:** Write custom Gson [`TypeAdapter`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html) implementations for the affected classes or change the type of your data. If this occurs for a field in one of your classes which you did not actually want to serialize or deserialize in the first place, you can exclude that field, see the [user guide](UserGuide.md#excluding-fields-from-serialization-and-deserialization).
+
+**Explanation:**
+
+When no built-in adapter for a type exists and no custom adapter has been registered, Gson falls back to using reflection to access the fields of a class (including `private` ones). Most likely you are seeing this error because you (by accident) rely on the reflection-based adapter for third-party classes. That should be avoided because you make yourself dependent on the implementation details of these classes which could change at any point. For the JDK it is also not possible anymore to access internal fields using reflection starting with JDK 17, see [JEP 403](https://openjdk.org/jeps/403).
+
+If you want to prevent using reflection on third-party classes in the future you can write your own [`ReflectionAccessFilter`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/ReflectionAccessFilter.html) or use one of the predefined ones, such as `ReflectionAccessFilter.BLOCK_ALL_PLATFORM`.
+
+## <a id="reflection-inaccessible-to-module-gson"></a> `InaccessibleObjectException`: 'module ... does not "opens ..." to module com.google.gson'
+
+**Symptom:** An exception with a message in the form 'module ... does not "opens ..." to module com.google.gson' is thrown
+
+**Reason:**
+
+- If the reported package is your own package then you have not configured the module declaration of your project to allow Gson to use reflection on your classes.
+- If the reported package is from a third party library or the JDK see [this troubleshooting point](#inaccessibleobjectexception-module--does-not-opens--to-unnamed-module).
+
+**Solution:** Make sure the `module-info.java` file of your project allows Gson to use reflection on your classes, for example:
+
+```java
+module mymodule {
+    requires com.google.gson;
+
+    opens mypackage to com.google.gson;
+}
+```
+
+Or in case this occurs for a field in one of your classes which you did not actually want to serialize or deserialize in the first place, you can exclude that field, see the [user guide](UserGuide.md#excluding-fields-from-serialization-and-deserialization).
+
+## <a id="android-app-random-names"></a> Android app not working in Release mode; random property names
+
+**Symptom:** Your Android app is working fine in Debug mode but fails in Release mode and the JSON properties have seemingly random names such as `a`, `b`, ...
+
+**Reason:** You probably have not configured ProGuard / R8 correctly
+
+**Solution:** Make sure you have configured ProGuard / R8 correctly to preserve the names of your fields. See the [Android example](examples/android-proguard-example/README.md) for more information.
+
+## <a id="android-app-broken-after-app-update"></a> Android app unable to parse JSON after app update
+
+**Symptom:** You released a new version of your Android app and it fails to parse JSON data created by the previous version of your app
+
+**Reason:** You probably have not configured ProGuard / R8 correctly; probably the fields names are being obfuscated and their naming changed between the versions of your app
+
+**Solution:** Make sure you have configured ProGuard / R8 correctly to preserve the names of your fields. See the [Android example](examples/android-proguard-example/README.md) for more information.
+
+If you want to preserve backward compatibility for you app you can use [`@SerializedName`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/annotations/SerializedName.html) on the fields to specify the obfuscated name as alternate, for example: `@SerializedName(value = "myprop", alternate = "a")`
+
+Normally ProGuard and R8 produce a mapping file, this makes it easier to find out the obfuscated field names instead of having to find them out through trial and error or other means. See the [Android Studio user guide](https://developer.android.com/studio/build/shrink-code.html#retracing) for more information.
+
+## <a id="default-field-values-missing"></a> Default field values not present after deserialization
+
+**Symptom:** You have assign default values to fields but after deserialization the fields have their standard value (such as `null` or `0`)
+
+**Reason:** Gson cannot invoke the constructor of your class and falls back to JDK `Unsafe` (or similar means)
+
+**Solution:** Make sure that the class:
+
+- is `static` (explicitly or implicitly when it is a top-level class)
+- has a no-args constructor
+
+Otherwise Gson will by default try to use JDK `Unsafe` or similar means to create an instance of your class without invoking the constructor and without running any initializers. You can also disable that behavior through [`GsonBuilder.disableJdkUnsafe()`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.html#disableJdkUnsafe()) to notice such issues early on.
+
+## <a id="anonymous-local-null"></a> `null` values for anonymous and local classes
+
+**Symptom:** Objects of a class are always serialized as JSON `null` / always deserialized as Java `null`
+
+**Reason:** The class you are serializing or deserializing is an anonymous or a local class (or you have specified a custom `ExclusionStrategy`)
+
+**Solution:** Convert the class to a `static` nested class. If the class is already `static` make sure you have not specified a Gson `ExclusionStrategy` which might exclude the class.
+
+Notes:
+
+- "double brace-initialization" also creates anonymous classes
+- Local record classes (feature added in Java 16) are supported by Gson and are not affected by this
+
+## <a id="map-key-wrong-json"></a> Map keys having unexpected format in JSON
+
+**Symptom:** JSON output for `Map` keys is unexpected / cannot be deserialized again
+
+**Reason:** The `Map` key type is 'complex' and you have not configured the `GsonBuilder` properly
+
+**Solution:** Use [`GsonBuilder.enableComplexMapKeySerialization()`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.html#enableComplexMapKeySerialization()). See also the [user guide](UserGuide.md#maps-examples) for more information.
+
+## <a id="malformed-json"></a> Parsing JSON fails with `MalformedJsonException`
+
+**Symptom:** JSON parsing fails with `MalformedJsonException`
+
+**Reason:** The JSON data is actually malformed
+
+**Solution:** During debugging, log the JSON data right before calling Gson methods or set a breakpoint to inspect the data and make sure it has the expected format. Sometimes APIs might return HTML error pages (instead of JSON data) when reaching rate limits or when other errors occur. Also read the location information of the `MalformedJsonException` exception message, it indicates where exactly in the document the malformed data was detected, including the [JSONPath](https://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/).
+
+For example, let's assume you want to deserialize the following JSON data:
+
+```json
+{
+  "languages": [
+    "English",
+    "French",
+  ]
+}
+```
+
+This will fail with an exception similar to this one: `MalformedJsonException: Use JsonReader.setLenient(true) to accept malformed JSON at line 5 column 4 path $.languages[2]`  
+The problem here is the trailing comma (`,`) after `"French"`, trailing commas are not allowed by the JSON specification. The location information "line 5 column 4" points to the `]` in the JSON data (with some slight inaccuracies) because Gson expected another value after `,` instead of the closing `]`. The JSONPath `$.languages[2]` in the exception message also points there: `$.` refers to the root object, `languages` refers to its member of that name and `[2]` refers to the (missing) third value in the JSON array value of that member (numbering starts at 0, so it is `[2]` instead of `[3]`).  
+The proper solution here is to fix the malformed JSON data.
+
+To spot syntax errors in the JSON data easily you can open it in an editor with support for JSON, for example Visual Studio Code. It will highlight within the JSON data the error location and show why the JSON data is considered invalid.
+
+## <a id="number-parsed-as-double"></a> Integral JSON number is parsed as `double`
+
+**Symptom:** JSON data contains an integral number such as `45` but Gson returns it as `double`
+
+**Reason:** When parsing a JSON number as `Object`, Gson will by default create always return a `double`
+
+**Solution:** Use [`GsonBuilder.setObjectToNumberStrategy`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.html#setObjectToNumberStrategy(com.google.gson.ToNumberStrategy)) to specify what type of number should be returned
+
+## <a id="default-lenient"></a> Malformed JSON not rejected
+
+**Symptom:** Gson parses malformed JSON without throwing any exceptions
+
+**Reason:** Due to legacy reasons Gson performs parsing by default in lenient mode
+
+**Solution:** See [`Gson` class documentation](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/Gson.html#default-lenient) section "Lenient JSON handling"
+
+Note: Even in non-lenient mode Gson deviates slightly from the JSON specification, see [`JsonReader.setLenient`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/stream/JsonReader.html#setLenient(boolean)) for more details.
+
+## <a id="unexpected-json-structure"></a> `IllegalStateException`: "Expected ... but was ..."
+
+**Symptom:** An `IllegalStateException` with a message in the form "Expected ... but was ..." is thrown
+
+**Reason:** The JSON data does not have the correct format
+
+**Solution:** Make sure that your classes correctly model the JSON data. Also during debugging log the JSON data right before calling Gson methods or set a breakpoint to inspect the data and make sure it has the expected format. Read the location information of the exception message, it indicates where exactly in the document the error occurred, including the [JSONPath](https://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/).
+
+For example, let's assume you have the following Java class:
+
+```java
+class WebPage {
+    String languages;
+}
+```
+
+And you want to deserialize the following JSON data:
+
+```json
+{
+  "languages": ["English", "French"]
+}
+```
+
+This will fail with an exception similar to this one: `IllegalStateException: Expected a string but was BEGIN_ARRAY at line 2 column 17 path $.languages`  
+This means Gson expected a JSON string value but found the beginning of a JSON array (`[`). The location information "line 2 column 17" points to the `[` in the JSON data (with some slight inaccuracies), so does the JSONPath `$.languages` in the exception message. It refers to the `languages` member of the root object (`$.`).  
+The solution here is to change in the `WebPage` class the field `String languages` to `List<String> languages`.
+
+## <a id="adapter-not-null-safe"></a> `IllegalStateException`: "Expected ... but was NULL"
+
+**Symptom:** An `IllegalStateException` with a message in the form "Expected ... but was NULL" is thrown
+
+**Reason:**
+
+- A built-in adapter does not support JSON null values
+- You have written a custom `TypeAdapter` which does not properly handle JSON null values
+
+**Solution:** If this occurs for a custom adapter you wrote, add code similar to the following at the beginning of its `read` method:
+
+```java
+@Override
+public MyClass read(JsonReader in) throws IOException {
+    if (in.peek() == JsonToken.NULL) {
+        in.nextNull();
+        return null;
+    }
+
+    ...
+}
+```
+
+Alternatively you can call [`nullSafe()`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html#nullSafe()) on the adapter instance you created.
+
+## <a id="serialize-nulls"></a> Properties missing in JSON
+
+**Symptom:** Properties are missing in the JSON output
+
+**Reason:** Gson by default omits JSON null from the output (or: ProGuard / R8 is not configured correctly and removed unused fields)
+
+**Solution:** Use [`GsonBuilder.serializeNulls()`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.html#serializeNulls())
+
+Note: Gson does not support anonymous and local classes and will serialize them as JSON null, see the [related troubleshooting point](#null-values-for-anonymous-and-local-classes).
+
+## <a id="android-internal-fields"></a> JSON output changes for newer Android versions
+
+**Symptom:** The JSON output differs when running on newer Android versions
+
+**Reason:** You use Gson by accident to access internal fields of Android classes
+
+**Solution:** Write custom Gson [`TypeAdapter`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html) implementations for the affected classes or change the type of your data
+
+**Explanation:**
+
+When no built-in adapter for a type exists and no custom adapter has been registered, Gson falls back to using reflection to access the fields of a class (including `private` ones). Most likely you are experiencing this issue because you (by accident) rely on the reflection-based adapter for Android classes. That should be avoided because you make yourself dependent on the implementation details of these classes which could change at any point.
+
+If you want to prevent using reflection on third-party classes in the future you can write your own [`ReflectionAccessFilter`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/ReflectionAccessFilter.html) or use one of the predefined ones, such as `ReflectionAccessFilter.BLOCK_ALL_PLATFORM`.
+
+## <a id="json-static-fields"></a> JSON output contains values of `static` fields
+
+**Symptom:** The JSON output contains values of `static` fields
+
+**Reason:** You used `GsonBuilder.excludeFieldsWithModifiers` to overwrite the default excluded modifiers
+
+**Solution:** When calling `GsonBuilder.excludeFieldsWithModifiers` you overwrite the default excluded modifiers. Therefore, you have to explicitly exclude `static` fields if desired. This can be done by adding `Modifier.STATIC` as additional argument.
+
+## <a id="no-such-method-error"></a> `NoSuchMethodError` when calling Gson methods
+
+**Symptom:** A `java.lang.NoSuchMethodError` is thrown when trying to call certain Gson methods
+
+**Reason:**
+
+- You have multiple versions of Gson on your classpath
+- Or, the Gson version you compiled against is different from the one on your classpath
+- Or, you are using a code shrinking tool such as ProGuard or R8 which removed methods from Gson
+
+**Solution:** First disable any code shrinking tools such as ProGuard or R8 and check if the issue persists. If not, you have to tweak the configuration of that tool to not modify Gson classes. Otherwise verify that the Gson JAR on your classpath is the same you are compiling against, and that there is only one Gson JAR on your classpath. See [this Stack Overflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/q/227486) to find out where a class is loaded from. For example, for debugging you could include the following code:
+
+```java
+System.out.println(Gson.class.getProtectionDomain().getCodeSource().getLocation());
+```
+
+If that fails with a `NullPointerException` you have to try one of the other ways to find out where a class is loaded from.
+
+## <a id="duplicate-fields"></a> `IllegalArgumentException`: 'Class ... declares multiple JSON fields named '...''
+
+**Symptom:** An exception with the message 'Class ... declares multiple JSON fields named '...'' is thrown
+
+**Reason:**
+
+- The name you have specified with a [`@SerializedName`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/annotations/SerializedName.html) annotation for a field collides with the name of another field
+- The [`FieldNamingStrategy`](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/FieldNamingStrategy.html) you have specified produces conflicting field names
+- A field of your class has the same name as the field of a superclass
+
+Gson prevents multiple fields with the same name because during deserialization it would be ambiguous for which field the JSON data should be deserialized. For serialization it would cause the same field to appear multiple times in JSON. While the JSON specification permits this, it is likely that the application parsing the JSON data will not handle it correctly.
+
+**Solution:** First identify the fields with conflicting names based on the exception message. Then decide if you want to rename one of them using the [`@SerializedName`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/annotations/SerializedName.html) annotation, or if you want to [exclude](UserGuide.md#excluding-fields-from-serialization-and-deserialization) one of them. When excluding one of the fields you have to include it for both serialization and deserialization (even if your application only performs one of these actions) because the duplicate field check cannot differentiate between these actions.
+
+## <a id="java-lang-class-unsupported"></a> `UnsupportedOperationException` when serializing or deserializing `java.lang.Class`
+
+**Symptom:** An `UnsupportedOperationException` is thrown when trying to serialize or deserialize `java.lang.Class`
+
+**Reason:** Gson intentionally does not permit serializing and deserializing `java.lang.Class` for security reasons. Otherwise a malicious user could make your application load an arbitrary class from the classpath and, depending on what your application does with the `Class`, in the worst case perform a remote code execution attack.
+
+**Solution:** First check if you really need to serialize or deserialize a `Class`. Often it is possible to use string aliases and then map them to the known `Class`; you could write a custom [`TypeAdapter`](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html) to do this. If the `Class` values are not known in advance, try to introduce a common base class or interface for all these classes and then verify that the deserialized class is a subclass. For example assuming the base class is called `MyBaseClass`, your custom `TypeAdapter` should load the class like this:
+
+```java
+Class.forName(jsonString, false, getClass().getClassLoader()).asSubclass(MyBaseClass.class)
+```
+
+This will not initialize arbitrary classes, and it will throw a `ClassCastException` if the loaded class is not the same as or a subclass of `MyBaseClass`.
+
+## <a id="type-token-raw"></a> `IllegalStateException`: 'TypeToken must be created with a type argument' <br> `RuntimeException`: 'Missing type parameter'
+
+**Symptom:** An `IllegalStateException` with the message 'TypeToken must be created with a type argument' is thrown.  
+For older Gson versions a `RuntimeException` with message 'Missing type parameter' is thrown.
+
+**Reason:**
+
+- You created a `TypeToken` without type argument, for example `new TypeToken() {}` (note the missing `<...>`). You always have to provide the type argument, for example like this: `new TypeToken<List<String>>() {}`. Normally the compiler will also emit a 'raw types' warning when you forget the `<...>`.
+- You are using a code shrinking tool such as ProGuard or R8 (Android app builds normally have this enabled by default) but have not configured it correctly for usage with Gson.
+
+**Solution:** When you are using a code shrinking tool such as ProGuard or R8 you have to adjust your configuration to include the following rules:
+

+## <a id="r8-abstract-class"></a> `JsonIOException`: 'Abstract classes can't be instantiated!' (R8)
+
+**Symptom:** A `JsonIOException` with the message 'Abstract classes can't be instantiated!' is thrown; the class mentioned in the exception message is not actually `abstract` in your source code, and you are using the code shrinking tool R8 (Android app builds normally have this configured by default).
+
+**Reason:** The code shrinking tool R8 performs optimizations where it may remove constructors and make classes `abstract`. Due to this Gson cannot create an instance of the class.
+
+**Solution:** Prefer keeping all constructors of the affected class. This is more robust for Kotlin, where classes commonly have a primary constructor and no no-args constructor.
+
+```
+# Keep all constructors of the deserialized class
+-keep class com.example.MyClass {
+  <init>(...);
+}
+```
+
+If you specifically rely on a no-args constructor, you can keep only that constructor, but ensure it actually exists:
+
+```
+# Keep the no-args constructor of the deserialized class
+-keepclassmembers class com.example.MyClass {
+  <init>();
+}
+```
+
+Alternatively for Android, you can annotate the class or its constructor with `@Keep` to avoid writing explicit ProGuard/R8 rules. See the Android documentation: https://developer.android.com/studio/write/annotations#keep
+
+Notes:
+
+- If R8 makes the class `abstract`, Gson cannot instantiate it even if constructors are present. Keeping the class (via `-keep` or `-keepclasseswithmembers`) and its constructors helps prevent this optimization.
+- If Gson cannot call a constructor (for example if none exists or is inaccessible), it may fall back to using JDK Unsafe to allocate instances without running constructors and initializers. This can result in missing default field values. You can disable this behavior via `GsonBuilder.disableJdkUnsafe()` to fail fast and surface configuration issues.
+- If the class which you are trying to deserialize is actually abstract in source, this exception is unrelated to R8. Implement a custom [`InstanceCreator`](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/InstanceCreator.html) or [`TypeAdapter`](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html) which creates an instance of a non-abstract subclass.
+
+For Android you can add these rules to the `proguard-rules.pro` file, see also the [Android documentation](https://developer.android.com/build/shrink-code#keep-code). In case the class name in the exception message is obfuscated, see the Android documentation about [retracing](https://developer.android.com/build/shrink-code#retracing).

Considerations:\n- Identify potential impacts on existing functionality\n- Consider backward compatibility\n- Note any dependencies or prerequisites\n\nDo NOT provide actual code snippets or diffs. Focus on describing what needs to be implemented.\n\nHere are the details for analysis:\n\nIssue title:\nImprove default ProGuard / R8 rules and Troubleshooting Guide\n\nIssue description: \n# Problem solved by the feature\nImprove the default ProGuard / R8 rules in `META-INF/proguard/gson.pro` added by #2397, and the Troubleshooting Guide.\n\n# Feature description\nI was testing the new default rules with an Android app and Kotlin classes, and there might be the following areas to improve.\n\n### Troubleshooting Guide: `JsonIOException`: \'Abstract classes can\'t be instantiated!\' (R8)\n\nThe Troubleshooting Guide currently suggests the following:\n```\n# Keep the no-args constructor of the deserialized class\n-keepclassmembers class com.example.MyClass {\n  <init>();\n}\n```\n\nThis means only the no-args constructor is kept, but not any other constructors. However, especially for Kotlin I assume it is common that classes don\'t have a no-args constructor because you might declare properties and the primary constructor at once, e.g. `class MyClass(val s: String)` (see [Kotlin documentation](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/classes.html#constructors)). Not sure though if using that is a good idea in combination with Gson because it then requires JDK Unsafe to create instances, but that is a different topic.\n\nSo there are two questions:\n- Should the Troubleshooting Guide rather recommend `<init>(...);` (all constructors), so that the users don\'t experience issues with R8 anymore (but implicitly depend on JDK Unsafe; using `GsonBuilder.disableJdkUnsafe()` would cause Gson to fail with a different exception)\n- Should the Troubleshooting Guide recommend `-keep` instead of `-keepclassmembers`. In case the `<init>` rule for the class properly matches a constructor it might not matter. But in case `<init>();` is used, but a no-args constructor does not exist, then `-keep` seems to at least have the side-effect that R8 does not make the class abstract (and then using JDK Unsafe an instance can be created).\n\n### Troubleshooting Guide: Recommend `@Keep` for Android\nInstead of configuring ProGuard / R8 rules, it might be easier for Android developers to use `@Keep` on the corresponding class or constructor, see https://developer.android.com/studio/write/annotations#keep\n\n### Preventing R8 from making classes abstract / removing no-args constructor\n\nIt would be good if we could adjust the default rules to avoid the "Abstract classes can\'t be instantiated!" exception (for most cases) in the first place.\n\nThere is probably no general way to detect if a class might be used with Gson, but the most reliable variant might be to keep the constructor if any of the Gson annotations is used by a class.\n\nThis can probably be achieved with an [`-if` rule](https://www.guardsquare.com/manual/configuration/usage#if) (see also [answers to this Stack Overflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/q/63162818)). For example:\n```\n# If class has fields with `@SerializedName` annotation keep its constructors\n-if class * {\n  @com.google.gson.annotations.SerializedName <fields>;\n}\n-keep class <1> {\n  <init>(...);\n}\n```\n(duplicated for all Gson annotations)\n\nBut it looks like this is not enough, maybe because there is no `-keep` (or `-keepclasseswithmembers`) rule for the class in the first place so `-if` somehow has no effect? You additionally need the following (duplicated for all Gson annotations probably):\n```\n-keepclasseswithmembers class * {\n  @com.google.gson.annotations.SerializedName <fields>;\n}\n```\nOnly then the class is not made abstract and the constructor is properly kept...\n\n(As side note: Having only the `-keepclasseswithmembers ... { @SerializedName }` above, but not the `-if ... -keep` seems to prevent R8 from making the class abstract, but still removes all constructors, so users would be dependent on JDK Unsafe then.)\n\nOr similar to https://github.com/google/gson/issues/2379#issuecomment-1564517629 maybe the following would work as well:\n```\n-keepclasseswithmembers class * {\n  <init>(...);\n  @com.google.gson.annotations.SerializedName <fields>;\n}\n```\nThere is however probably no need for the `-if` rule shown in the original comment, unless that has some special effect, see https://github.com/google/gson/pull/2397#issuecomment-1575236086.\n\n### R8 makes class abstract but still keeps constructors\n\nIt also looks like the Android app build creates (for some reason) additional constructors / keeps constructors even when the class is made abstract. Due to this, the Troubleshooting Guide URLs are unfortunately not included in the exception messages (they are only added at the moment when there are no constructors).\nNot really sure why these constructors exist in the first place and are kept even when the class is made abstract. In the R8 integration test of Gson this behavior was not seen.\n\nMaybe we should remove the `getDeclaredConstructors().length == 0` check if the class is abstract and always refer to the Troubleshooting Guide. The guide would have to be adjusted then though to also properly cover the case where the class was indeed abstract in the source code.\n\n---\n\nAny additional feedback is highly appreciated!\n\n\nIssue comments:\n\n\nFeature Context:\nFile: Troubleshooting.md\nLine number range: 1 - 329\nContent:\n1. # Troubleshooting Guide\n2. \n3. This guide describes how to troubleshoot common issues when using Gson.\n4. \n5. <!-- The \'<a id="..."></a>\' anchors below are used to create stable links; don\'t remove or rename them -->\n6. <!-- Use only lowercase IDs, GitHub seems to not support uppercase IDs, see also https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/50962 -->\n7. \n8. ## <a id="class-cast-exception"></a> `ClassCastException` when using deserialized object\n9. \n10. **Symptom:** `ClassCastException` is thrown when accessing an object deserialized by Gson\n11. \n12. **Reason:** Your code is most likely not type-safe\n13. \n14. **Solution:** Make sure your code adheres to the following:\n15. \n16. - Avoid raw types: Instead of calling `fromJson(..., List.class)`, create for example a `TypeToken<List<MyClass>>`.\n17.   See the [user guide](UserGuide.md#collections-examples) for more information.\n18. - When using `TypeToken` prefer the `Gson.fromJson` overloads with `TypeToken` parameter such as [`fromJson(Reader, TypeToken)`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/Gson.html#fromJson(java.io.Reader,com.google.gson.reflect.TypeToken)).\n19.   The overloads with `Type` parameter do not provide any type-safety guarantees.\n20. - When using `TypeToken` make sure you don\'t capture a type variable. For example avoid something like `new TypeToken<List<T>>()` (where `T` is a type variable). Due to Java type erasure the actual type of `T` is not available at runtime. Refactor your code to pass around `TypeToken` instances or use [`TypeToken.getParameterized(...)`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/reflect/TypeToken.html#getParameterized(java.lang.reflect.Type,java.lang.reflect.Type...)), for example `TypeToken.getParameterized(List.class, elementClass)`.\n21. \n22. ## <a id="reflection-inaccessible"></a> `InaccessibleObjectException`: \'module ... does not "opens ..." to unnamed module\'\n23. \n24. **Symptom:** An exception with a message in the form \'module ... does not "opens ..." to unnamed module\' is thrown\n25. \n26. **Reason:** You use Gson by accident to access internal fields of third-party classes\n27. \n28. **Solution:** Write custom Gson [`TypeAdapter`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html) implementations for the affected classes or change the type of your data. If this occurs for a field in one of your classes which you did not actually want to serialize or deserialize in the first place, you can exclude that field, see the [user guide](UserGuide.md#excluding-fields-from-serialization-and-deserialization).\n29. \n30. **Explanation:**\n31. \n32. When no built-in adapter for a type exists and no custom adapter has been registered, Gson falls back to using reflection to access the fields of a class (including `private` ones). Most likely you are seeing this error because you (by accident) rely on the reflection-based adapter for third-party classes. That should be avoided because you make yourself dependent on the implementation details of these classes which could change at any point. For the JDK it is also not possible anymore to access internal fields using reflection starting with JDK 17, see [JEP 403](https://openjdk.org/jeps/403).\n33. \n34. If you want to prevent using reflection on third-party classes in the future you can write your own [`ReflectionAccessFilter`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/ReflectionAccessFilter.html) or use one of the predefined ones, such as `ReflectionAccessFilter.BLOCK_ALL_PLATFORM`.\n35. \n36. ## <a id="reflection-inaccessible-to-module-gson"></a> `InaccessibleObjectException`: \'module ... does not "opens ..." to module com.google.gson\'\n37. \n38. **Symptom:** An exception with a message in the form \'module ... does not "opens ..." to module com.google.gson\' is thrown\n39. \n40. **Reason:**\n41. \n42. - If the reported package is your own package then you have not configured the module declaration of your project to allow Gson to use reflection on your classes.\n43. - If the reported package is from a third party library or the JDK see [this troubleshooting point](#inaccessibleobjectexception-module--does-not-opens--to-unnamed-module).\n44. \n45. **Solution:** Make sure the `module-info.java` file of your project allows Gson to use reflection on your classes, for example:\n46. \n47. ```java\n48. module mymodule {\n49.     requires com.google.gson;\n50. \n51.     opens mypackage to com.google.gson;\n52. }\n53. ```\n54. \n55. Or in case this occurs for a field in one of your classes which you did not actually want to serialize or deserialize in the first place, you can exclude that field, see the [user guide](UserGuide.md#excluding-fields-from-serialization-and-deserialization).\n56. \n57. ## <a id="android-app-random-names"></a> Android app not working in Release mode; random property names\n58. \n59. **Symptom:** Your Android app is working fine in Debug mode but fails in Release mode and the JSON properties have seemingly random names such as `a`, `b`, ...\n60. \n61. **Reason:** You probably have not configured ProGuard / R8 correctly\n62. \n63. **Solution:** Make sure you have configured ProGuard / R8 correctly to preserve the names of your fields. See the [Android example](examples/android-proguard-example/README.md) for more information.\n64. \n65. ## <a id="android-app-broken-after-app-update"></a> Android app unable to parse JSON after app update\n66. \n67. **Symptom:** You released a new version of your Android app and it fails to parse JSON data created by the previous version of your app\n68. \n69. **Reason:** You probably have not configured ProGuard / R8 correctly; probably the fields names are being obfuscated and their naming changed between the versions of your app\n70. \n71. **Solution:** Make sure you have configured ProGuard / R8 correctly to preserve the names of your fields. See the [Android example](examples/android-proguard-example/README.md) for more information.\n72. \n73. If you want to preserve backward compatibility for you app you can use [`@SerializedName`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/annotations/SerializedName.html) on the fields to specify the obfuscated name as alternate, for example: `@SerializedName(value = "myprop", alternate = "a")`\n74. \n75. Normally ProGuard and R8 produce a mapping file, this makes it easier to find out the obfuscated field names instead of having to find them out through trial and error or other means. See the [Android Studio user guide](https://developer.android.com/studio/build/shrink-code.html#retracing) for more information.\n76. \n77. ## <a id="default-field-values-missing"></a> Default field values not present after deserialization\n78. \n79. **Symptom:** You have assign default values to fields but after deserialization the fields have their standard value (such as `null` or `0`)\n80. \n81. **Reason:** Gson cannot invoke the constructor of your class and falls back to JDK `Unsafe` (or similar means)\n82. \n83. **Solution:** Make sure that the class:\n84. \n85. - is `static` (explicitly or implicitly when it is a top-level class)\n86. - has a no-args constructor\n87. \n88. Otherwise Gson will by default try to use JDK `Unsafe` or similar means to create an instance of your class without invoking the constructor and without running any initializers. You can also disable that behavior through [`GsonBuilder.disableJdkUnsafe()`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.html#disableJdkUnsafe()) to notice such issues early on.\n89. \n90. ## <a id="anonymous-local-null"></a> `null` values for anonymous and local classes\n91. \n92. **Symptom:** Objects of a class are always serialized as JSON `null` / always deserialized as Java `null`\n93. \n94. **Reason:** The class you are serializing or deserializing is an anonymous or a local class (or you have specified a custom `ExclusionStrategy`)\n95. \n96. **Solution:** Convert the class to a `static` nested class. If the class is already `static` make sure you have not specified a Gson `ExclusionStrategy` which might exclude the class.\n97. \n98. Notes:\n99. \n100. - "double brace-initialization" also creates anonymous classes\n101. - Local record classes (feature added in Java 16) are supported by Gson and are not affected by this\n102. \n103. ## <a id="map-key-wrong-json"></a> Map keys having unexpected format in JSON\n104. \n105. **Symptom:** JSON output for `Map` keys is unexpected / cannot be deserialized again\n106. \n107. **Reason:** The `Map` key type is \'complex\' and you have not configured the `GsonBuilder` properly\n108. \n109. **Solution:** Use [`GsonBuilder.enableComplexMapKeySerialization()`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.html#enableComplexMapKeySerialization()). See also the [user guide](UserGuide.md#maps-examples) for more information.\n110. \n111. ## <a id="malformed-json"></a> Parsing JSON fails with `MalformedJsonException`\n112. \n113. **Symptom:** JSON parsing fails with `MalformedJsonException`\n114. \n115. **Reason:** The JSON data is actually malformed\n116. \n117. **Solution:** During debugging, log the JSON data right before calling Gson methods or set a breakpoint to inspect the data and make sure it has the expected format. Sometimes APIs might return HTML error pages (instead of JSON data) when reaching rate limits or when other errors occur. Also read the location information of the `MalformedJsonException` exception message, it indicates where exactly in the document the malformed data was detected, including the [JSONPath](https://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/).\n118. \n119. For example, let\'s assume you want to deserialize the following JSON data:\n120. \n121. ```json\n122. {\n123.   "languages": [\n124.     "English",\n125.     "French",\n126.   ]\n127. }\n128. ```\n129. \n130. This will fail with an exception similar to this one: `MalformedJsonException: Use JsonReader.setLenient(true) to accept malformed JSON at line 5 column 4 path $.languages[2]`  \n131. The problem here is the trailing comma (`,`) after `"French"`, trailing commas are not allowed by the JSON specification. The location information "line 5 column 4" points to the `]` in the JSON data (with some slight inaccuracies) because Gson expected another value after `,` instead of the closing `]`. The JSONPath `$.languages[2]` in the exception message also points there: `$.` refers to the root object, `languages` refers to its member of that name and `[2]` refers to the (missing) third value in the JSON array value of that member (numbering starts at 0, so it is `[2]` instead of `[3]`).  \n132. The proper solution here is to fix the malformed JSON data.\n133. \n134. To spot syntax errors in the JSON data easily you can open it in an editor with support for JSON, for example Visual Studio Code. It will highlight within the JSON data the error location and show why the JSON data is considered invalid.\n135. \n136. ## <a id="number-parsed-as-double"></a> Integral JSON number is parsed as `double`\n137. \n138. **Symptom:** JSON data contains an integral number such as `45` but Gson returns it as `double`\n139. \n140. **Reason:** When parsing a JSON number as `Object`, Gson will by default create always return a `double`\n141. \n142. **Solution:** Use [`GsonBuilder.setObjectToNumberStrategy`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.html#setObjectToNumberStrategy(com.google.gson.ToNumberStrategy)) to specify what type of number should be returned\n143. \n144. ## <a id="default-lenient"></a> Malformed JSON not rejected\n145. \n146. **Symptom:** Gson parses malformed JSON without throwing any exceptions\n147. \n148. **Reason:** Due to legacy reasons Gson performs parsing by default in lenient mode\n149. \n150. **Solution:** See [`Gson` class documentation](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/Gson.html#default-lenient) section "Lenient JSON handling"\n151. \n152. Note: Even in non-lenient mode Gson deviates slightly from the JSON specification, see [`JsonReader.setLenient`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/stream/JsonReader.html#setLenient(boolean)) for more details.\n153. \n154. ## <a id="unexpected-json-structure"></a> `IllegalStateException`: "Expected ... but was ..."\n155. \n156. **Symptom:** An `IllegalStateException` with a message in the form "Expected ... but was ..." is thrown\n157. \n158. **Reason:** The JSON data does not have the correct format\n159. \n160. **Solution:** Make sure that your classes correctly model the JSON data. Also during debugging log the JSON data right before calling Gson methods or set a breakpoint to inspect the data and make sure it has the expected format. Read the location information of the exception message, it indicates where exactly in the document the error occurred, including the [JSONPath](https://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/).\n161. \n162. For example, let\'s assume you have the following Java class:\n163. \n164. ```java\n165. class WebPage {\n166.     String languages;\n167. }\n168. ```\n169. \n170. And you want to deserialize the following JSON data:\n171. \n172. ```json\n173. {\n174.   "languages": ["English", "French"]\n175. }\n176. ```\n177. \n178. This will fail with an exception similar to this one: `IllegalStateException: Expected a string but was BEGIN_ARRAY at line 2 column 17 path $.languages`  \n179. This means Gson expected a JSON string value but found the beginning of a JSON array (`[`). The location information "line 2 column 17" points to the `[` in the JSON data (with some slight inaccuracies), so does the JSONPath `$.languages` in the exception message. It refers to the `languages` member of the root object (`$.`).  \n180. The solution here is to change in the `WebPage` class the field `String languages` to `List<String> languages`.\n181. \n182. ## <a id="adapter-not-null-safe"></a> `IllegalStateException`: "Expected ... but was NULL"\n183. \n184. **Symptom:** An `IllegalStateException` with a message in the form "Expected ... but was NULL" is thrown\n185. \n186. **Reason:**\n187. \n188. - A built-in adapter does not support JSON null values\n189. - You have written a custom `TypeAdapter` which does not properly handle JSON null values\n190. \n191. **Solution:** If this occurs for a custom adapter you wrote, add code similar to the following at the beginning of its `read` method:\n192. \n193. ```java\n194. @Override\n195. public MyClass read(JsonReader in) throws IOException {\n196.     if (in.peek() == JsonToken.NULL) {\n197.         in.nextNull();\n198.         return null;\n199.     }\n200. \n201.     ...\n202. }\n203. ```\n204. \n205. Alternatively you can call [`nullSafe()`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html#nullSafe()) on the adapter instance you created.\n206. \n207. ## <a id="serialize-nulls"></a> Properties missing in JSON\n208. \n209. **Symptom:** Properties are missing in the JSON output\n210. \n211. **Reason:** Gson by default omits JSON null from the output (or: ProGuard / R8 is not configured correctly and removed unused fields)\n212. \n213. **Solution:** Use [`GsonBuilder.serializeNulls()`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.html#serializeNulls())\n214. \n215. Note: Gson does not support anonymous and local classes and will serialize them as JSON null, see the [related troubleshooting point](#null-values-for-anonymous-and-local-classes).\n216. \n217. ## <a id="android-internal-fields"></a> JSON output changes for newer Android versions\n218. \n219. **Symptom:** The JSON output differs when running on newer Android versions\n220. \n221. **Reason:** You use Gson by accident to access internal fields of Android classes\n222. \n223. **Solution:** Write custom Gson [`TypeAdapter`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html) implementations for the affected classes or change the type of your data\n224. \n225. **Explanation:**\n226. \n227. When no built-in adapter for a type exists and no custom adapter has been registered, Gson falls back to using reflection to access the fields of a class (including `private` ones). Most likely you are experiencing this issue because you (by accident) rely on the reflection-based adapter for Android classes. That should be avoided because you make yourself dependent on the implementation details of these classes which could change at any point.\n228. \n229. If you want to prevent using reflection on third-party classes in the future you can write your own [`ReflectionAccessFilter`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/ReflectionAccessFilter.html) or use one of the predefined ones, such as `ReflectionAccessFilter.BLOCK_ALL_PLATFORM`.\n230. \n231. ## <a id="json-static-fields"></a> JSON output contains values of `static` fields\n232. \n233. **Symptom:** The JSON output contains values of `static` fields\n234. \n235. **Reason:** You used `GsonBuilder.excludeFieldsWithModifiers` to overwrite the default excluded modifiers\n236. \n237. **Solution:** When calling `GsonBuilder.excludeFieldsWithModifiers` you overwrite the default excluded modifiers. Therefore, you have to explicitly exclude `static` fields if desired. This can be done by adding `Modifier.STATIC` as additional argument.\n238. \n239. ## <a id="no-such-method-error"></a> `NoSuchMethodError` when calling Gson methods\n240. \n241. **Symptom:** A `java.lang.NoSuchMethodError` is thrown when trying to call certain Gson methods\n242. \n243. **Reason:**\n244. \n245. - You have multiple versions of Gson on your classpath\n246. - Or, the Gson version you compiled against is different from the one on your classpath\n247. - Or, you are using a code shrinking tool such as ProGuard or R8 which removed methods from Gson\n248. \n249. **Solution:** First disable any code shrinking tools such as ProGuard or R8 and check if the issue persists. If not, you have to tweak the configuration of that tool to not modify Gson classes. Otherwise verify that the Gson JAR on your classpath is the same you are compiling against, and that there is only one Gson JAR on your classpath. See [this Stack Overflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/q/227486) to find out where a class is loaded from. For example, for debugging you could include the following code:\n250. \n251. ```java\n252. System.out.println(Gson.class.getProtectionDomain().getCodeSource().getLocation());\n253. ```\n254. \n255. If that fails with a `NullPointerException` you have to try one of the other ways to find out where a class is loaded from.\n256. \n257. ## <a id="duplicate-fields"></a> `IllegalArgumentException`: \'Class ... declares multiple JSON fields named \'...\'\'\n258. \n259. **Symptom:** An exception with the message \'Class ... declares multiple JSON fields named \'...\'\' is thrown\n260. \n261. **Reason:**\n262. \n263. - The name you have specified with a [`@SerializedName`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/annotations/SerializedName.html) annotation for a field collides with the name of another field\n264. - The [`FieldNamingStrategy`](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/FieldNamingStrategy.html) you have specified produces conflicting field names\n265. - A field of your class has the same name as the field of a superclass\n266. \n267. Gson prevents multiple fields with the same name because during deserialization it would be ambiguous for which field the JSON data should be deserialized. For serialization it would cause the same field to appear multiple times in JSON. While the JSON specification permits this, it is likely that the application parsing the JSON data will not handle it correctly.\n268. \n269. **Solution:** First identify the fields with conflicting names based on the exception message. Then decide if you want to rename one of them using the [`@SerializedName`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/annotations/SerializedName.html) annotation, or if you want to [exclude](UserGuide.md#excluding-fields-from-serialization-and-deserialization) one of them. When excluding one of the fields you have to include it for both serialization and deserialization (even if your application only performs one of these actions) because the duplicate field check cannot differentiate between these actions.\n270. \n271. ## <a id="java-lang-class-unsupported"></a> `UnsupportedOperationException` when serializing or deserializing `java.lang.Class`\n272. \n273. **Symptom:** An `UnsupportedOperationException` is thrown when trying to serialize or deserialize `java.lang.Class`\n274. \n275. **Reason:** Gson intentionally does not permit serializing and deserializing `java.lang.Class` for security reasons. Otherwise a malicious user could make your application load an arbitrary class from the classpath and, depending on what your application does with the `Class`, in the worst case perform a remote code execution attack.\n276. \n277. **Solution:** First check if you really need to serialize or deserialize a `Class`. Often it is possible to use string aliases and then map them to the known `Class`; you could write a custom [`TypeAdapter`](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html) to do this. If the `Class` values are not known in advance, try to introduce a common base class or interface for all these classes and then verify that the deserialized class is a subclass. For example assuming the base class is called `MyBaseClass`, your custom `TypeAdapter` should load the class like this:\n278. \n279. ```java\n280. Class.forName(jsonString, false, getClass().getClassLoader()).asSubclass(MyBaseClass.class)\n281. ```\n282. \n283. This will not initialize arbitrary classes, and it will throw a `ClassCastException` if the loaded class is not the same as or a subclass of `MyBaseClass`.\n284. \n285. ## <a id="type-token-raw"></a> `IllegalStateException`: \'TypeToken must be created with a type argument\' <br> `RuntimeException`: \'Missing type parameter\'\n286. \n287. **Symptom:** An `IllegalStateException` with the message \'TypeToken must be created with a type argument\' is thrown.  \n288. For older Gson versions a `RuntimeException` with message \'Missing type parameter\' is thrown.\n289. \n290. **Reason:**\n291. \n292. - You created a `TypeToken` without type argument, for example `new TypeToken() {}` (note the missing `<...>`). You always have to provide the type argument, for example like this: `new TypeToken<List<String>>() {}`. Normally the compiler will also emit a \'raw types\' warning when you forget the `<...>`.\n293. - You are using a code shrinking tool such as ProGuard or R8 (Android app builds normally have this enabled by default) but have not configured it correctly for usage with Gson.\n294. \n295. **Solution:** When you are using a code shrinking tool such as ProGuard or R8 you have to adjust your configuration to include the following rules:\n296. \n297. ```\n298. # Keep generic signatures; needed for correct type resolution\n299. -keepattributes Signature\n300. \n301. # Keep class TypeToken (respectively its generic signature)\n302. -keep class com.google.gson.reflect.TypeToken { *; }\n303. \n304. # Keep any (anonymous) classes extending TypeToken\n305. -keep class * extends com.google.gson.reflect.TypeToken\n306. ```\n307. \n308. See also the [Android example](examples/android-proguard-example/README.md) for more information.\n309. \n310. Note: For newer Gson versions these rules might be applied automatically; make sure you are using the latest Gson version and the latest version of the code shrinking tool.\n311. \n312. ## <a id="r8-abstract-class"></a> `JsonIOException`: \'Abstract classes can\'t be instantiated!\' (R8)\n313. \n314. **Symptom:** A `JsonIOException` with the message \'Abstract classes can\'t be instantiated!\' is thrown; the class mentioned in the exception message is not actually `abstract` in your source code, and you are using the code shrinking tool R8 (Android app builds normally have this configured by default).\n315. \n316. **Reason:** The code shrinking tool R8 performs optimizations where it removes the no-args constructor from a class and makes the class `abstract`. Due to this Gson cannot create an instance of the class.\n317. \n318. **Solution:** Make sure the class has a no-args constructor, then adjust your R8 configuration file to keep the constructor of the class. For example:\n319. \n320. ```\n321. # Keep the no-args constructor of the deserialized class\n322. -keepclassmembers class com.example.MyClass {\n323.   <init>();\n324. }\n325. ```\n326. \n327. For Android you can add this rule to the `proguard-rules.pro` file, see also the [Android documentation](https://developer.android.com/build/shrink-code#keep-code). In case the class name in the exception message is obfuscated, see the Android documentation about [retracing](https://developer.android.com/build/shrink-code#retracing).\n328. \n329. Note: If the class which you are trying to deserialize is actually abstract, then this exception is probably unrelated to R8 and you will have to implement a custom [`InstanceCreator`](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/InstanceCreator.html) or [`TypeAdapter`](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html) which creates an instance of a non-abstract subclass of the class.\n\n\nFile: examples/android-proguard-example/README.md\nLine number range: 1 - 17\nContent:\n1. # android-proguard-example\n2. \n3. Example Android project showing how to properly configure [ProGuard](https://www.guardsquare.com/proguard).\n4. ProGuard is a tool for \'shrinking\' and obfuscating compiled classes. It can rename methods and fields,\n5. or remove them if they appear to be unused. This can cause issues for Gson which uses Java reflection to\n6. access the fields of a class. It is necessary to configure ProGuard to make sure that Gson works correctly.\n7. \n8. Also have a look at the [ProGuard manual](https://www.guardsquare.com/manual/configuration/usage#keepoverview)\n9. and the [ProGuard Gson examples](https://www.guardsquare.com/manual/configuration/examples#gson) for more\n10. details on how ProGuard can be configured.\n11. \n12. The R8 code shrinker uses the same rule format as ProGuard, but there are differences between these two\n13. tools. Have a look at R8\'s Compatibility FAQ, and especially at the [Gson section](https://r8.googlesource.com/r8/+/refs/heads/main/compatibility-faq.md#gson).\n14. \n15. Note that newer Gson versions apply some of the rules shown in `proguard.cfg` automatically by default,\n16. see the file [`gson/META-INF/proguard/gson.pro`](/gson/src/main/resources/META-INF/proguard/gson.pro) for\n17. the Gson version you are using.\n\n\nFile: gson/src/main/java/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.java\nLine number range: 103 - 106\nContent:\n103.   private boolean generateNonExecutableJson = DEFAULT_JSON_NON_EXECUTABLE;\n104.   private boolean lenient = DEFAULT_LENIENT;\n105.   private boolean useJdkUnsafe = DEFAULT_USE_JDK_UNSAFE;\n106.   private ToNumberStrategy objectToNumberStrategy = DEFAULT_OBJECT_TO_NUMBER_STRATEGY;\n\n\nFile: gson/src/main/java/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.java\nLine number range: 756 - 760\nContent:\n756.   @CanIgnoreReturnValue\n757.   public GsonBuilder disableJdkUnsafe() {\n758.     this.useJdkUnsafe = false;\n759.     return this;\n760.   }\n\n\nFile: gson/src/main/java/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.java\nLine number range: 806 - 813\nContent:\n806.     return new Gson(excluder, fieldNamingPolicy, new HashMap<>(instanceCreators),\n807.         serializeNulls, complexMapKeySerialization,\n808.         generateNonExecutableJson, escapeHtmlChars, formattingStyle, lenient,\n809.         serializeSpecialFloatingPointValues, useJdkUnsafe, longSerializationPolicy,\n810.         datePattern, dateStyle, timeStyle, new ArrayList<>(this.factories),\n811.         new ArrayList<>(this.hierarchyFactories), factories,\n812.         objectToNumberStrategy, numberToNumberStrategy, new ArrayList<>(reflectionFilters));\n813.   }\n\n\nFile: gson/src/main/java/com/google/gson/JsonIOException.java\nLine number range: 16 - 45\nContent:\n16. package com.google.gson;\n17. \n18. /**\n19.  * This exception is raised when Gson was unable to read an input stream\n20.  * or write to one.\n21.  * \n22.  * @author Inderjeet Singh\n23.  * @author Joel Leitch\n24.  */\n25. public final class JsonIOException extends JsonParseException {\n26.   private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;\n27. \n28.   public JsonIOException(String msg) {\n29.     super(msg);\n30.   }\n31. \n32.   public JsonIOException(String msg, Throwable cause) {\n33.     super(msg, cause);\n34.   }\n35. \n36.   /**\n37.    * Creates exception with the specified cause.

Title: Improve default ProGuard / R8 rules and Troubleshooting Guide
URL: https://github.com/google/gson/issues/2401
Content: (duplicated for all Gson annotations)

But it looks like this is not enough, maybe because there is no `-keep` (or `-keepclasseswithmembers`) rule for the class in the first place so `-if` somehow has no effect? You additionally need the following (duplicated for all Gson annotations probably):

```
-keepclasseswithmembers class  { @com.google.gson.annotations.SerializedName ; } 
```

Only then the class is not made abstract and the constructor is properly kept... [...] (As side note: Having only the `-keepclasseswithmembers ... { @SerializedName }` above, but not the `-if ... -keep` seems to prevent R8 from making the class abstract, but still removes all constructors, so users would be dependent on JDK Unsafe then.)

Or similar to #2379 (comment) maybe the following would work as well:

```
-keepclasseswithmembers class  { (...); @com.google.gson.annotations.SerializedName ; } 
``` [...] There is however probably no need for the `-if` rule shown in the original comment, unless that has some special effect, see #2397 (comment).

### R8 makes class abstract but still keeps constructors

Title: gson/Troubleshooting.md at main · google/gson · GitHub
URL: https://github.com/google/gson/blob/main/Troubleshooting.md
Content: Reason: The code shrinking tool R8 performs optimizations where it removes the no-args constructor from a class and makes the class `abstract`. Due to this Gson cannot create an instance of the class.

Solution: Make sure the class has a no-args constructor, then adjust your R8 configuration file to keep the constructor of the class. For example:

```
# Keep the no-args constructor of the deserialized class
-keepclassmembers class com.example.MyClass {
  <init>();
}

``` [...] See the ProGuard / R8 section for more information.

Note: For newer Gson versions these rules might be applied automatically; make sure you are using the latest Gson version and the latest version of the code shrinking tool.

## `JsonIOException`: 'Abstract classes can't be instantiated!' (R8) [...] You can’t perform that action at this time.

All of these proguard rules has been added automatically on Gson 2.11.0

so just upgrade the Gson dependency

Initially it is false. So just delete that line. Hope it will run and wont give any error. Do not make false, delete the line from gradle.prepertis

```
android.useAndroidX=true android.enableJetifier=true kotlin.code.style=official 
```

and add these three line if not there.

2025-11-09 02:55:00,283 - thread-140613253072576.prometheus.lang_graph.nodes.issue_feature_analyzer_node - DEBUG - content='Below is a structured, high-level plan to implement the requested improvements to default ProGuard/R8 rules and the Troubleshooting Guide, and to adjust runtime messaging to better cover R8 behaviors observed with Android/Kotlin.\n\n1. Feature Understanding\n\n- Desired functionality and requirements:\n  - Strengthen the default consumer ProGuard/R8 rules shipped with Gson to reduce or eliminate R8-induced issues where classes are made abstract and/or constructors are removed, leading to JsonIOException: “Abstract classes can’t be instantiated!” during deserialization.\n  - Update the Troubleshooting Guide to recommend rules that better match real-world Android/Kotlin usage:\n    - Prefer keeping all constructors rather than only the no-args constructor, to avoid R8 making the class abstract.\n    - Clarify trade-offs when classes don’t have a no-args constructor (e.g., Kotlin primary constructor), and how this interacts with Gson’s use of JDK Unsafe and GsonBuilder.disableJdkUnsafe().\n    - Recommend Android’s @Keep annotation as a simpler alternative for app developers.\n  - Adjust runtime exception messaging to include Troubleshooting Guide URLs even when R8 makes a class abstract but constructors are still present (so that users see actionable guidance in more cases).\n- Ambiguities and edge cases to clarify in documentation:\n  - Gson does not invoke parameterized constructors by default; keeping all constructors helps prevent R8 from abstracting/removing them, but it does not change how Gson instantiates objects. If a class has no no-args constructor, Gson will typically use Unsafe unless disabled (disableJdkUnsafe()). Document this explicitly.\n  - Using -keep vs -keepclassmembers: -keep may over-preserve complete classes (size/obfuscation impact). For consumer rules, prefer narrower rules that target only relevant classes (e.g., classes with Gson annotations).\n  - Annotations scope: reflect that Gson supports @SerializedName on fields and rejects it on accessor methods; rules should focus on field- and type-level annotations, not method annotations.\n  - R8 behavior differences: sometimes classes are abstract but constructors still exist. Runtime messaging should handle this uniformly.\n\n2. Architecture Analysis\n\n- Files/modules to create or modify:\n  - gson/src/main/resources/META-INF/proguard/gson.pro\n    - Augment default consumer rules to keep constructors for classes likely to be used with Gson (e.g., classes having Gson annotations).\n  - Troubleshooting.md\n    - Update the “Abstract classes can’t be instantiated!” section to recommend better rules and discuss Kotlin/JDK Unsafe.\n    - Add guidance for @Keep annotation usage on Android.\n    - Cross-reference related sections (default field values missing, disableJdkUnsafe).\n  - examples/android-proguard-example/README.md\n    - Highlight that newer Gson versions include consumer rules by default; add examples of @Keep and revised rule guidance.\n  - gson/src/main/java/com/google/gson/internal/ConstructorConstructor.java\n    - Update the abstract-class instantiation check to always include a Troubleshooting Guide URL, even when constructors exist, to provide users a direct path to fixes.\n- Integration points and conventions:\n  - The consumer rules are applied automatically by Android builds that support consumer ProGuard configs via META-INF/proguard/*.pro in the dependency.\n  - TroubleshootingGuide.createUrl(...) is already used in ConstructorConstructor; leverage it to add links consistently.\n  - Keep consistency with existing doc anchors and styles in Troubleshooting.md.\n  - Avoid changing Gson’s instantiation behavior; only improve messaging and docs.\n\n3. Implementation Plan\n\n- Change 1: Strengthen consumer ProGuard/R8 rules\n  - File: gson/src/main/resources/META-INF/proguard/gson.pro\n  - Additions:\n    - Introduce rules that keep constructors for classes likely used with Gson based on presence of Gson annotations on fields or types. Specifically target:\n      - com.google.gson.annotations.SerializedName (on fields)\n      - com.google.gson.annotations.Expose (on fields)\n      - com.google.gson.annotations.JsonAdapter (on types and fields)\n      - com.google.gson.annotations.Since (on fields and types)\n      - com.google.gson.annotations.Until (on fields and types)\n    - Use rules that both prevent classes from being made abstract and preserve constructors. Prefer -keepclasseswithmembers matching:\n      - classes where fields are annotated with these Gson annotations, and\n      - classes where type-level annotations apply (JsonAdapter, Since, Until).\n    - Keep all constructors <init>(...) for matched classes (not just the no-args constructor) to mitigate R8’s “abstract class” optimization.\n    - Optional: If supported reliably by target shrinkers, add -if rules as a complement to select classes with these annotations and keep constructors; however, ensure the baseline behavior works without -if (some users run older versions). The baseline should rely on -keepclasseswithmembers to avoid the abstracting/removal behavior.\n    - Do not keep methods or fields broadly; focus the rules narrowly to reduce size impact and maintain obfuscation elsewhere.\n  - Why this integrates correctly:\n    - The consumer rules apply automatically to Android builds, reducing the need for app developers to manually configure ProGuard/R8.\n    - Targeting only annotated classes limits the scope to classes demonstrably used with Gson, minimizing over-preservation.\n\n- Change 2: Update Troubleshooting Guide for R8/Kotlin/Android\n  - File: Troubleshooting.md\n  - Section updates:\n    - Section id “r8-abstract-class”:\n      - Replace the “keep only no-args constructor” recommendation with guidance to keep all constructors of the affected class (<init>(...);) to prevent R8 abstracting/removing them. Explain that Gson does not call parameterized constructors by default; this rule mainly prevents R8-induced abstracting/removal.\n      - Add a sub-note for Kotlin classes without a no-args constructor:\n        - Explain that Gson will use JDK Unsafe when no no-args constructor exists (unless disableJdkUnsafe() is used), and that keeping constructors does not make Gson call them. Point to InstanceCreator or custom TypeAdapter if constructor invocation is needed.\n        - Mention the trade-off of using GsonBuilder.disableJdkUnsafe(): if disabled, deserialization will fail for classes without a no-args constructor; include link to that builder option in javadoc.\n      - Clarify -keep vs -keepclassmembers behavior and recommend -keepclasseswithmembers as the safer, narrower consumer rule approach; -keep may be used by app developers for specific classes if they prefer broad preservation.\n      - Recommend Android’s @Keep annotation for simpler per-class or per-constructor preservation (include link to developer.android.com’s @Keep documentation). Explain this as an alternative to rule configuration.\n      - Mention retracing guidance when class names are obfuscated (leave existing links intact).\n    - Cross-link to “default-field-values-missing” to reinforce how constructors and Unsafe behavior affect initialization.\n  - Maintain anchor IDs and style consistency.\n\n- Change 3: Update Android example documentation\n  - File: examples/android-proguard-example/README.md\n  - Additions:\n    - Note that recent Gson versions ship consumer rules automatically; app developers may need minimal additional configuration.\n    - Show guidance to annotate classes or constructors with @Keep for simpler control on Android, and explain when to prefer this over manual rules.\n    - Mention that for Kotlin classes without no-args constructors, keeping all constructors helps prevent R8 abstracting/removing, but Gson won’t invoke those constructors; recommend InstanceCreator or TypeAdapter if needed.\n\n- Change 4: Improve runtime messaging for abstract class cases\n  - File: gson/src/main/java/com/google/gson/internal/ConstructorConstructor.java\n  - Method: checkInstantiable(Class<?> c)\n  - Adjustment:\n    - Currently, the Troubleshooting Guide URL is appended only if the class is abstract and has zero declared constructors.\n    - Modify the logic to always include the Troubleshooting Guide URL for abstract classes (both when constructors are absent and when constructors are present), because the underlying user issue (R8 optimization or actual abstract type usage) is the same from a user’s perspective and the Guide provides actionable fixes.\n    - Keep the specific messages for interfaces and genuine abstract classes, but append TroubleshootingGuide.createUrl("r8-abstract-class") consistently in the abstract branch.\n  - Why this integrates correctly:\n    - Uses existing TroubleshootingGuide.createUrl and preserves backward compatibility while making exceptions more helpful.\n    - Avoids reliance on constructor count that varies across R8 behaviors; users receive consistent guidance.\n\n4. Considerations\n\n- Potential impacts on existing functionality:\n  - Consumer rules:\n    - Keeping constructors for annotated classes slightly reduces shrinking potential for those classes. The scope is constrained by annotations, reducing impact size-wise and preserving obfuscation for non-Gson classes.\n    - Avoids changing Gson’s runtime instantiation logic; no behavioral changes to Gson’s deserialization internals beyond improved exception messages.\n  - Documentation:\n    - Updated recommendations may change developer expectations; ensure clarity around Unsafe use and no-args constructor requirements.\n- Backward compatibility:\n  - Ensure added consumer rules use ProGuard/R8 directives available on commonly used versions. Favor -keepclasseswithmembers, which is widely supported. If adding -if rules, ensure baseline behavior does not depend on -if so older tools still benefit.\n  - Exception message changes maintain the same class of exception and only add more guidance; no API changes.\n- Dependencies or prerequisites:\n  - The effectiveness of consumer rules depends on the Android Gradle Plugin and R8/ProGuard versions used by app developers. Document that users should keep these up-to-date.\n  - If -if rules are included, note they require a reasonably recent shrinker; otherwise, document fallback behavior powered by -keepclasseswithmembers.\n- Testing and validation (recommended):\n  - Extend the existing R8 integration test(s) to cover:\n    - Classes with @SerializedName/@Expose/etc. annotated fields and verify constructors are preserved and classes are not abstracted.\n    - Kotlin data-class style types without no-args constructors to ensure consumer rules prevent abstracting/removal and to confirm runtime messaging includes the Troubleshooting link even when constructors exist.\n  - Verify exception messages include the Troubleshooting URL for abstract classes under both observed R8 behaviors (zero or non-zero declared constructors).\n\nThis plan focuses changes on consumer ProGuard/R8 rules and documentation, along with a small, targeted change to exception messaging, to reduce Android/R8 friction for Gson users without altering Gson’s core instantiation behavior.' additional_kwargs={'refusal': None} response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 4598, 'prompt_tokens': 15096, 'total_tokens': 19694, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'reasoning_tokens': 2432, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': 0, 'cached_tokens': 13312}}, 'model_name': 'gpt-5-2025-08-07', 'system_fingerprint': None, 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None} id='run--a038b0c9-844c-4b10-9fae-3c5d58bf551d-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 15096, 'output_tokens': 4598, 'total_tokens': 19694, 'input_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'cache_read': 13312}, 'output_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'reasoning': 2432}}

content='--- BEGIN ISSUE INFO ---\nIssue title:\nImprove default ProGuard / R8 rules and Troubleshooting Guide\n\nIssue description: \n# Problem solved by the feature\nImprove the default ProGuard / R8 rules in `META-INF/proguard/gson.pro` added by #2397, and the Troubleshooting Guide.\n\n# Feature description\nI was testing the new default rules with an Android app and Kotlin classes, and there might be the following areas to improve.\n\n### Troubleshooting Guide: `JsonIOException`: \'Abstract classes can\'t be instantiated!\' (R8)\n\nThe Troubleshooting Guide currently suggests the following:\n```\n# Keep the no-args constructor of the deserialized class\n-keepclassmembers class com.example.MyClass {\n  <init>();\n}\n```\n\nThis means only the no-args constructor is kept, but not any other constructors. However, especially for Kotlin I assume it is common that classes don\'t have a no-args constructor because you might declare properties and the primary constructor at once, e.g. `class MyClass(val s: String)` (see [Kotlin documentation](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/classes.html#constructors)). Not sure though if using that is a good idea in combination with Gson because it then requires JDK Unsafe to create instances, but that is a different topic.\n\nSo there are two questions:\n- Should the Troubleshooting Guide rather recommend `<init>(...);` (all constructors), so that the users don\'t experience issues with R8 anymore (but implicitly depend on JDK Unsafe; using `GsonBuilder.disableJdkUnsafe()` would cause Gson to fail with a different exception)\n- Should the Troubleshooting Guide recommend `-keep` instead of `-keepclassmembers`. In case the `<init>` rule for the class properly matches a constructor it might not matter. But in case `<init>();` is used, but a no-args constructor does not exist, then `-keep` seems to at least have the side-effect that R8 does not make the class abstract (and then using JDK Unsafe an instance can be created).\n\n### Troubleshooting Guide: Recommend `@Keep` for Android\nInstead of configuring ProGuard / R8 rules, it might be easier for Android developers to use `@Keep` on the corresponding class or constructor, see https://developer.android.com/studio/write/annotations#keep\n\n### Preventing R8 from making classes abstract / removing no-args constructor\n\nIt would be good if we could adjust the default rules to avoid the "Abstract classes can\'t be instantiated!" exception (for most cases) in the first place.\n\nThere is probably no general way to detect if a class might be used with Gson, but the most reliable variant might be to keep the constructor if any of the Gson annotations is used by a class.\n\nThis can probably be achieved with an [`-if` rule](https://www.guardsquare.com/manual/configuration/usage#if) (see also [answers to this Stack Overflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/q/63162818)). For example:\n```\n# If class has fields with `@SerializedName` annotation keep its constructors\n-if class * {\n  @com.google.gson.annotations.SerializedName <fields>;\n}\n-keep class <1> {\n  <init>(...);\n}\n```\n(duplicated for all Gson annotations)\n\nBut it looks like this is not enough, maybe because there is no `-keep` (or `-keepclasseswithmembers`) rule for the class in the first place so `-if` somehow has no effect? You additionally need the following (duplicated for all Gson annotations probably):\n```\n-keepclasseswithmembers class * {\n  @com.google.gson.annotations.SerializedName <fields>;\n}\n```\nOnly then the class is not made abstract and the constructor is properly kept...\n\n(As side note: Having only the `-keepclasseswithmembers ... { @SerializedName }` above, but not the `-if ... -keep` seems to prevent R8 from making the class abstract, but still removes all constructors, so users would be dependent on JDK Unsafe then.)\n\nOr similar to https://github.com/google/gson/issues/2379#issuecomment-1564517629 maybe the following would work as well:\n```\n-keepclasseswithmembers class * {\n  <init>(...);\n  @com.google.gson.annotations.SerializedName <fields>;\n}\n```\nThere is however probably no need for the `-if` rule shown in the original comment, unless that has some special effect, see https://github.com/google/gson/pull/2397#issuecomment-1575236086.\n\n### R8 makes class abstract but still keeps constructors\n\nIt also looks like the Android app build creates (for some reason) additional constructors / keeps constructors even when the class is made abstract. Due to this, the Troubleshooting Guide URLs are unfortunately not included in the exception messages (they are only added at the moment when there are no constructors).\nNot really sure why these constructors exist in the first place and are kept even when the class is made abstract. In the R8 integration test of Gson this behavior was not seen.\n\nMaybe we should remove the `getDeclaredConstructors().length == 0` check if the class is abstract and always refer to the Troubleshooting Guide. The guide would have to be adjusted then though to also properly cover the case where the class was indeed abstract in the source code.\n\n---\n\nAny additional feedback is highly appreciated!\n\n\nIssue comments:\n\n--- END ISSUE INFO ---\n\nContext Found:\n--- BEGIN CONTEXT ---\nFile: Troubleshooting.md\nLine number range: 1 - 329\nContent:\n1. # Troubleshooting Guide\n2. \n3. This guide describes how to troubleshoot common issues when using Gson.\n4. \n5. <!-- The \'<a id="..."></a>\' anchors below are used to create stable links; don\'t remove or rename them -->\n6. <!-- Use only lowercase IDs, GitHub seems to not support uppercase IDs, see also https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/50962 -->\n7. \n8. ## <a id="class-cast-exception"></a> `ClassCastException` when using deserialized object\n9. \n10. **Symptom:** `ClassCastException` is thrown when accessing an object deserialized by Gson\n11. \n12. **Reason:** Your code is most likely not type-safe\n13. \n14. **Solution:** Make sure your code adheres to the following:\n15. \n16. - Avoid raw types: Instead of calling `fromJson(..., List.class)`, create for example a `TypeToken<List<MyClass>>`.\n17.   See the [user guide](UserGuide.md#collections-examples) for more information.\n18. - When using `TypeToken` prefer the `Gson.fromJson` overloads with `TypeToken` parameter such as [`fromJson(Reader, TypeToken)`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/Gson.html#fromJson(java.io.Reader,com.google.gson.reflect.TypeToken)).\n19.   The overloads with `Type` parameter do not provide any type-safety guarantees.\n20. - When using `TypeToken` make sure you don\'t capture a type variable. For example avoid something like `new TypeToken<List<T>>()` (where `T` is a type variable). Due to Java type erasure the actual type of `T` is not available at runtime. Refactor your code to pass around `TypeToken` instances or use [`TypeToken.getParameterized(...)`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/reflect/TypeToken.html#getParameterized(java.lang.reflect.Type,java.lang.reflect.Type...)), for example `TypeToken.getParameterized(List.class, elementClass)`.\n21. \n22. ## <a id="reflection-inaccessible"></a> `InaccessibleObjectException`: \'module ... does not "opens ..." to unnamed module\'\n23. \n24. **Symptom:** An exception with a message in the form \'module ... does not "opens ..." to unnamed module\' is thrown\n25. \n26. **Reason:** You use Gson by accident to access internal fields of third-party classes\n27. \n28. **Solution:** Write custom Gson [`TypeAdapter`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html) implementations for the affected classes or change the type of your data. If this occurs for a field in one of your classes which you did not actually want to serialize or deserialize in the first place, you can exclude that field, see the [user guide](UserGuide.md#excluding-fields-from-serialization-and-deserialization).\n29. \n30. **Explanation:**\n31. \n32. When no built-in adapter for a type exists and no custom adapter has been registered, Gson falls back to using reflection to access the fields of a class (including `private` ones). Most likely you are seeing this error because you (by accident) rely on the reflection-based adapter for third-party classes. That should be avoided because you make yourself dependent on the implementation details of these classes which could change at any point. For the JDK it is also not possible anymore to access internal fields using reflection starting with JDK 17, see [JEP 403](https://openjdk.org/jeps/403).\n33. \n34. If you want to prevent using reflection on third-party classes in the future you can write your own [`ReflectionAccessFilter`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/ReflectionAccessFilter.html) or use one of the predefined ones, such as `ReflectionAccessFilter.BLOCK_ALL_PLATFORM`.\n35. \n36. ## <a id="reflection-inaccessible-to-module-gson"></a> `InaccessibleObjectException`: \'module ... does not "opens ..." to module com.google.gson\'\n37. \n38. **Symptom:** An exception with a message in the form \'module ... does not "opens ..." to module com.google.gson\' is thrown\n39. \n40. **Reason:**\n41. \n42. - If the reported package is your own package then you have not configured the module declaration of your project to allow Gson to use reflection on your classes.\n43. - If the reported package is from a third party library or the JDK see [this troubleshooting point](#inaccessibleobjectexception-module--does-not-opens--to-unnamed-module).\n44. \n45. **Solution:** Make sure the `module-info.java` file of your project allows Gson to use reflection on your classes, for example:\n46. \n47. ```java\n48. module mymodule {\n49.     requires com.google.gson;\n50. \n51.     opens mypackage to com.google.gson;\n52. }\n53. ```\n54. \n55. Or in case this occurs for a field in one of your classes which you did not actually want to serialize or deserialize in the first place, you can exclude that field, see the [user guide](UserGuide.md#excluding-fields-from-serialization-and-deserialization).\n56. \n57. ## <a id="android-app-random-names"></a> Android app not working in Release mode; random property names\n58. \n59. **Symptom:** Your Android app is working fine in Debug mode but fails in Release mode and the JSON properties have seemingly random names such as `a`, `b`, ...\n60. \n61. **Reason:** You probably have not configured ProGuard / R8 correctly\n62. \n63. **Solution:** Make sure you have configured ProGuard / R8 correctly to preserve the names of your fields. See the [Android example](examples/android-proguard-example/README.md) for more information.\n64. \n65. ## <a id="android-app-broken-after-app-update"></a> Android app unable to parse JSON after app update\n66. \n67. **Symptom:** You released a new version of your Android app and it fails to parse JSON data created by the previous version of your app\n68. \n69. **Reason:** You probably have not configured ProGuard / R8 correctly; probably the fields names are being obfuscated and their naming changed between the versions of your app\n70. \n71. **Solution:** Make sure you have configured ProGuard / R8 correctly to preserve the names of your fields. See the [Android example](examples/android-proguard-example/README.md) for more information.\n72. \n73. If you want to preserve backward compatibility for you app you can use [`@SerializedName`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/annotations/SerializedName.html) on the fields to specify the obfuscated name as alternate, for example: `@SerializedName(value = "myprop", alternate = "a")`\n74. \n75. Normally ProGuard and R8 produce a mapping file, this makes it easier to find out the obfuscated field names instead of having to find them out through trial and error or other means. See the [Android Studio user guide](https://developer.android.com/studio/build/shrink-code.html#retracing) for more information.\n76. \n77. ## <a id="default-field-values-missing"></a> Default field values not present after deserialization\n78. \n79. **Symptom:** You have assign default values to fields but after deserialization the fields have their standard value (such as `null` or `0`)\n80. \n81. **Reason:** Gson cannot invoke the constructor of your class and falls back to JDK `Unsafe` (or similar means)\n82. \n83. **Solution:** Make sure that the class:\n84. \n85. - is `static` (explicitly or implicitly when it is a top-level class)\n86. - has a no-args constructor\n87. \n88. Otherwise Gson will by default try to use JDK `Unsafe` or similar means to create an instance of your class without invoking the constructor and without running any initializers. You can also disable that behavior through [`GsonBuilder.disableJdkUnsafe()`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.html#disableJdkUnsafe()) to notice such issues early on.\n89. \n90. ## <a id="anonymous-local-null"></a> `null` values for anonymous and local classes\n91. \n92. **Symptom:** Objects of a class are always serialized as JSON `null` / always deserialized as Java `null`\n93. \n94. **Reason:** The class you are serializing or deserializing is an anonymous or a local class (or you have specified a custom `ExclusionStrategy`)\n95. \n96. **Solution:** Convert the class to a `static` nested class. If the class is already `static` make sure you have not specified a Gson `ExclusionStrategy` which might exclude the class.\n97. \n98. Notes:\n99. \n100. - "double brace-initialization" also creates anonymous classes\n101. - Local record classes (feature added in Java 16) are supported by Gson and are not affected by this\n102. \n103. ## <a id="map-key-wrong-json"></a> Map keys having unexpected format in JSON\n104. \n105. **Symptom:** JSON output for `Map` keys is unexpected / cannot be deserialized again\n106. \n107. **Reason:** The `Map` key type is \'complex\' and you have not configured the `GsonBuilder` properly\n108. \n109. **Solution:** Use [`GsonBuilder.enableComplexMapKeySerialization()`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.html#enableComplexMapKeySerialization()). See also the [user guide](UserGuide.md#maps-examples) for more information.\n110. \n111. ## <a id="malformed-json"></a> Parsing JSON fails with `MalformedJsonException`\n112. \n113. **Symptom:** JSON parsing fails with `MalformedJsonException`\n114. \n115. **Reason:** The JSON data is actually malformed\n116. \n117. **Solution:** During debugging, log the JSON data right before calling Gson methods or set a breakpoint to inspect the data and make sure it has the expected format. Sometimes APIs might return HTML error pages (instead of JSON data) when reaching rate limits or when other errors occur. Also read the location information of the `MalformedJsonException` exception message, it indicates where exactly in the document the malformed data was detected, including the [JSONPath](https://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/).\n118. \n119. For example, let\'s assume you want to deserialize the following JSON data:\n120. \n121. ```json\n122. {\n123.   "languages": [\n124.     "English",\n125.     "French",\n126.   ]\n127. }\n128. ```\n129. \n130. This will fail with an exception similar to this one: `MalformedJsonException: Use JsonReader.setLenient(true) to accept malformed JSON at line 5 column 4 path $.languages[2]`  \n131. The problem here is the trailing comma (`,`) after `"French"`, trailing commas are not allowed by the JSON specification. The location information "line 5 column 4" points to the `]` in the JSON data (with some slight inaccuracies) because Gson expected another value after `,` instead of the closing `]`. The JSONPath `$.languages[2]` in the exception message also points there: `$.` refers to the root object, `languages` refers to its member of that name and `[2]` refers to the (missing) third value in the JSON array value of that member (numbering starts at 0, so it is `[2]` instead of `[3]`).  \n132. The proper solution here is to fix the malformed JSON data.\n133. \n134. To spot syntax errors in the JSON data easily you can open it in an editor with support for JSON, for example Visual Studio Code. It will highlight within the JSON data the error location and show why the JSON data is considered invalid.\n135. \n136. ## <a id="number-parsed-as-double"></a> Integral JSON number is parsed as `double`\n137. \n138. **Symptom:** JSON data contains an integral number such as `45` but Gson returns it as `double`\n139. \n140. **Reason:** When parsing a JSON number as `Object`, Gson will by default create always return a `double`\n141. \n142. **Solution:** Use [`GsonBuilder.setObjectToNumberStrategy`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.html#setObjectToNumberStrategy(com.google.gson.ToNumberStrategy)) to specify what type of number should be returned\n143. \n144. ## <a id="default-lenient"></a> Malformed JSON not rejected\n145. \n146. **Symptom:** Gson parses malformed JSON without throwing any exceptions\n147. \n148. **Reason:** Due to legacy reasons Gson performs parsing by default in lenient mode\n149. \n150. **Solution:** See [`Gson` class documentation](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/Gson.html#default-lenient) section "Lenient JSON handling"\n151. \n152. Note: Even in non-lenient mode Gson deviates slightly from the JSON specification, see [`JsonReader.setLenient`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/stream/JsonReader.html#setLenient(boolean)) for more details.\n153. \n154. ## <a id="unexpected-json-structure"></a> `IllegalStateException`: "Expected ... but was ..."\n155. \n156. **Symptom:** An `IllegalStateException` with a message in the form "Expected ... but was ..." is thrown\n157. \n158. **Reason:** The JSON data does not have the correct format\n159. \n160. **Solution:** Make sure that your classes correctly model the JSON data. Also during debugging log the JSON data right before calling Gson methods or set a breakpoint to inspect the data and make sure it has the expected format. Read the location information of the exception message, it indicates where exactly in the document the error occurred, including the [JSONPath](https://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/).\n161. \n162. For example, let\'s assume you have the following Java class:\n163. \n164. ```java\n165. class WebPage {\n166.     String languages;\n167. }\n168. ```\n169. \n170. And you want to deserialize the following JSON data:\n171. \n172. ```json\n173. {\n174.   "languages": ["English", "French"]\n175. }\n176. ```\n177. \n178. This will fail with an exception similar to this one: `IllegalStateException: Expected a string but was BEGIN_ARRAY at line 2 column 17 path $.languages`  \n179. This means Gson expected a JSON string value but found the beginning of a JSON array (`[`). The location information "line 2 column 17" points to the `[` in the JSON data (with some slight inaccuracies), so does the JSONPath `$.languages` in the exception message. It refers to the `languages` member of the root object (`$.`).  \n180. The solution here is to change in the `WebPage` class the field `String languages` to `List<String> languages`.\n181. \n182. ## <a id="adapter-not-null-safe"></a> `IllegalStateException`: "Expected ... but was NULL"\n183. \n184. **Symptom:** An `IllegalStateException` with a message in the form "Expected ... but was NULL" is thrown\n185. \n186. **Reason:**\n187. \n188. - A built-in adapter does not support JSON null values\n189. - You have written a custom `TypeAdapter` which does not properly handle JSON null values\n190. \n191. **Solution:** If this occurs for a custom adapter you wrote, add code similar to the following at the beginning of its `read` method:\n192. \n193. ```java\n194. @Override\n195. public MyClass read(JsonReader in) throws IOException {\n196.     if (in.peek() == JsonToken.NULL) {\n197.         in.nextNull();\n198.         return null;\n199.     }\n200. \n201.     ...\n202. }\n203. ```\n204. \n205. Alternatively you can call [`nullSafe()`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html#nullSafe()) on the adapter instance you created.\n206. \n207. ## <a id="serialize-nulls"></a> Properties missing in JSON\n208. \n209. **Symptom:** Properties are missing in the JSON output\n210. \n211. **Reason:** Gson by default omits JSON null from the output (or: ProGuard / R8 is not configured correctly and removed unused fields)\n212. \n213. **Solution:** Use [`GsonBuilder.serializeNulls()`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.html#serializeNulls())\n214. \n215. Note: Gson does not support anonymous and local classes and will serialize them as JSON null, see the [related troubleshooting point](#null-values-for-anonymous-and-local-classes).\n216. \n217. ## <a id="android-internal-fields"></a> JSON output changes for newer Android versions\n218. \n219. **Symptom:** The JSON output differs when running on newer Android versions\n220. \n221. **Reason:** You use Gson by accident to access internal fields of Android classes\n222. \n223. **Solution:** Write custom Gson [`TypeAdapter`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html) implementations for the affected classes or change the type of your data\n224. \n225. **Explanation:**\n226. \n227. When no built-in adapter for a type exists and no custom adapter has been registered, Gson falls back to using reflection to access the fields of a class (including `private` ones). Most likely you are experiencing this issue because you (by accident) rely on the reflection-based adapter for Android classes. That should be avoided because you make yourself dependent on the implementation details of these classes which could change at any point.\n228. \n229. If you want to prevent using reflection on third-party classes in the future you can write your own [`ReflectionAccessFilter`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/ReflectionAccessFilter.html) or use one of the predefined ones, such as `ReflectionAccessFilter.BLOCK_ALL_PLATFORM`.\n230. \n231. ## <a id="json-static-fields"></a> JSON output contains values of `static` fields\n232. \n233. **Symptom:** The JSON output contains values of `static` fields\n234. \n235. **Reason:** You used `GsonBuilder.excludeFieldsWithModifiers` to overwrite the default excluded modifiers\n236. \n237. **Solution:** When calling `GsonBuilder.excludeFieldsWithModifiers` you overwrite the default excluded modifiers. Therefore, you have to explicitly exclude `static` fields if desired. This can be done by adding `Modifier.STATIC` as additional argument.\n238. \n239. ## <a id="no-such-method-error"></a> `NoSuchMethodError` when calling Gson methods\n240. \n241. **Symptom:** A `java.lang.NoSuchMethodError` is thrown when trying to call certain Gson methods\n242. \n243. **Reason:**\n244. \n245. - You have multiple versions of Gson on your classpath\n246. - Or, the Gson version you compiled against is different from the one on your classpath\n247. - Or, you are using a code shrinking tool such as ProGuard or R8 which removed methods from Gson\n248. \n249. **Solution:** First disable any code shrinking tools such as ProGuard or R8 and check if the issue persists. If not, you have to tweak the configuration of that tool to not modify Gson classes. Otherwise verify that the Gson JAR on your classpath is the same you are compiling against, and that there is only one Gson JAR on your classpath. See [this Stack Overflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/q/227486) to find out where a class is loaded from. For example, for debugging you could include the following code:\n250. \n251. ```java\n252. System.out.println(Gson.class.getProtectionDomain().getCodeSource().getLocation());\n253. ```\n254. \n255. If that fails with a `NullPointerException` you have to try one of the other ways to find out where a class is loaded from.\n256. \n257. ## <a id="duplicate-fields"></a> `IllegalArgumentException`: \'Class ... declares multiple JSON fields named \'...\'\'\n258. \n259. **Symptom:** An exception with the message \'Class ... declares multiple JSON fields named \'...\'\' is thrown\n260. \n261. **Reason:**\n262. \n263. - The name you have specified with a [`@SerializedName`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/annotations/SerializedName.html) annotation for a field collides with the name of another field\n264. - The [`FieldNamingStrategy`](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/FieldNamingStrategy.html) you have specified produces conflicting field names\n265. - A field of your class has the same name as the field of a superclass\n266. \n267. Gson prevents multiple fields with the same name because during deserialization it would be ambiguous for which field the JSON data should be deserialized. For serialization it would cause the same field to appear multiple times in JSON. While the JSON specification permits this, it is likely that the application parsing the JSON data will not handle it correctly.\n268. \n269. **Solution:** First identify the fields with conflicting names based on the exception message. Then decide if you want to rename one of them using the [`@SerializedName`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/annotations/SerializedName.html) annotation, or if you want to [exclude](UserGuide.md#excluding-fields-from-serialization-and-deserialization) one of them. When excluding one of the fields you have to include it for both serialization and deserialization (even if your application only performs one of these actions) because the duplicate field check cannot differentiate between these actions.\n270. \n271. ## <a id="java-lang-class-unsupported"></a> `UnsupportedOperationException` when serializing or deserializing `java.lang.Class`\n272. \n273. **Symptom:** An `UnsupportedOperationException` is thrown when trying to serialize or deserialize `java.lang.Class`\n274. \n275. **Reason:** Gson intentionally does not permit serializing and deserializing `java.lang.Class` for security reasons. Otherwise a malicious user could make your application load an arbitrary class from the classpath and, depending on what your application does with the `Class`, in the worst case perform a remote code execution attack.\n276. \n277. **Solution:** First check if you really need to serialize or deserialize a `Class`. Often it is possible to use string aliases and then map them to the known `Class`; you could write a custom [`TypeAdapter`](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html) to do this. If the `Class` values are not known in advance, try to introduce a common base class or interface for all these classes and then verify that the deserialized class is a subclass. For example assuming the base class is called `MyBaseClass`, your custom `TypeAdapter` should load the class like this:\n278. \n279. ```java\n280. Class.forName(jsonString, false, getClass().getClassLoader()).asSubclass(MyBaseClass.class)\n281. ```\n282. \n283. This will not initialize arbitrary classes, and it will throw a `ClassCastException` if the loaded class is not the same as or a subclass of `MyBaseClass`.\n284. \n285. ## <a id="type-token-raw"></a> `IllegalStateException`: \'TypeToken must be created with a type argument\' <br> `RuntimeException`: \'Missing type parameter\'\n286. \n287. **Symptom:** An `IllegalStateException` with the message \'TypeToken must be created with a type argument\' is thrown.  \n288. For older Gson versions a `RuntimeException` with message \'Missing type parameter\' is thrown.\n289. \n290. **Reason:**\n291. \n292. - You created a `TypeToken` without type argument, for example `new TypeToken() {}` (note the missing `<...>`). You always have to provide the type argument, for example like this: `new TypeToken<List<String>>() {}`. Normally the compiler will also emit a \'raw types\' warning when you forget the `<...>`.\n293. - You are using a code shrinking tool such as ProGuard or R8 (Android app builds normally have this enabled by default) but have not configured it correctly for usage with Gson.\n294. \n295. **Solution:** When you are using a code shrinking tool such as ProGuard or R8 you have to adjust your configuration to include the following rules:\n296. \n297. ```\n298. # Keep generic signatures; needed for correct type resolution\n299. -keepattributes Signature\n300. \n301. # Keep class TypeToken (respectively its generic signature)\n302. -keep class com.google.gson.reflect.TypeToken { *; }\n303. \n304. # Keep any (anonymous) classes extending TypeToken\n305. -keep class * extends com.google.gson.reflect.TypeToken\n306. ```\n307. \n308. See also the [Android example](examples/android-proguard-example/README.md) for more information.\n309. \n310. Note: For newer Gson versions these rules might be applied automatically; make sure you are using the latest Gson version and the latest version of the code shrinking tool.\n311. \n312. ## <a id="r8-abstract-class"></a> `JsonIOException`: \'Abstract classes can\'t be instantiated!\' (R8)\n313. \n314. **Symptom:** A `JsonIOException` with the message \'Abstract classes can\'t be instantiated!\' is thrown; the class mentioned in the exception message is not actually `abstract` in your source code, and you are using the code shrinking tool R8 (Android app builds normally have this configured by default).\n315. \n316. **Reason:** The code shrinking tool R8 performs optimizations where it removes the no-args constructor from a class and makes the class `abstract`. Due to this Gson cannot create an instance of the class.\n317. \n318. **Solution:** Make sure the class has a no-args constructor, then adjust your R8 configuration file to keep the constructor of the class. For example:\n319. \n320. ```\n321. # Keep the no-args constructor of the deserialized class\n322. -keepclassmembers class com.example.MyClass {\n323.   <init>();\n324. }\n325. ```\n326. \n327. For Android you can add this rule to the `proguard-rules.pro` file, see also the [Android documentation](https://developer.android.com/build/shrink-code#keep-code). In case the class name in the exception message is obfuscated, see the Android documentation about [retracing](https://developer.android.com/build/shrink-code#retracing).\n328. \n329. Note: If the class which you are trying to deserialize is actually abstract, then this exception is probably unrelated to R8 and you will have to implement a custom [`InstanceCreator`](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/InstanceCreator.html) or [`TypeAdapter`](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html) which creates an instance of a non-abstract subclass of the class.\n\n\nFile: examples/android-proguard-example/README.md\nLine number range: 1 - 17\nContent:\n1. # android-proguard-example\n2. \n3. Example Android project showing how to properly configure [ProGuard](https://www.guardsquare.com/proguard).\n4. ProGuard is a tool for \'shrinking\' and obfuscating compiled classes. It can rename methods and fields,\n5. or remove them if they appear to be unused. This can cause issues for Gson which uses Java reflection to\n6. access the fields of a class. It is necessary to configure ProGuard to make sure that Gson works correctly.\n7. \n8. Also have a look at the [ProGuard manual](https://www.guardsquare.com/manual/configuration/usage#keepoverview)\n9. and the [ProGuard Gson examples](https://www.guardsquare.com/manual/configuration/examples#gson) for more\n10. details on how ProGuard can be configured.\n11. \n12. The R8 code shrinker uses the same rule format as ProGuard, but there are differences between these two\n13. tools. Have a look at R8\'s Compatibility FAQ, and especially at the [Gson section](https://r8.googlesource.com/r8/+/refs/heads/main/compatibility-faq.md#gson).\n14. \n15. Note that newer Gson versions apply some of the rules shown in `proguard.cfg` automatically by default,\n16. see the file [`gson/META-INF/proguard/gson.pro`](/gson/src/main/resources/META-INF/proguard/gson.pro) for\n17. the Gson version you are using.\n\n\nFile: gson/src/main/java/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.java\nLine number range: 103 - 106\nContent:\n103.   private boolean generateNonExecutableJson = DEFAULT_JSON_NON_EXECUTABLE;\n104.   private boolean lenient = DEFAULT_LENIENT;\n105.   private boolean useJdkUnsafe = DEFAULT_USE_JDK_UNSAFE;\n106.   private ToNumberStrategy objectToNumberStrategy = DEFAULT_OBJECT_TO_NUMBER_STRATEGY;\n\n\nFile: gson/src/main/java/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.java\nLine number range: 756 - 760\nContent:\n756.   @CanIgnoreReturnValue\n757.   public GsonBuilder disableJdkUnsafe() {\n758.     this.useJdkUnsafe = false;\n759.     return this;\n760.   }\n\n\nFile: gson/src/main/java/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.java\nLine number range: 806 - 813\nContent:\n806.     return new Gson(excluder, fieldNamingPolicy, new HashMap<>(instanceCreators),\n807.         serializeNulls, complexMapKeySerialization,\n808.         generateNonExecutableJson, escapeHtmlChars, formattingStyle, lenient,\n809.         serializeSpecialFloatingPointValues, useJdkUnsafe, longSerializationPolicy,\n810.         datePattern, dateStyle, timeStyle, new ArrayList<>(this.factories),\n811.         new ArrayList<>(this.hierarchyFactories), factories,\n812.         objectToNumberStrategy, numberToNumberStrategy, new ArrayList<>(reflectionFilters));\n813.   }\n\n\nFile: gson/src/main/java/com/google/gson/JsonIOException.java\nLine number range: 16 - 45\nContent:\n16. package com.google.gson;\n17. \n18. /**\n19.  * This exception is raised when Gson was unable to read an input stream\n20.  * or write to one.\n21.  * \n22.  * @author Inderjeet Singh\n23.  * @author Joel Leitch\n24.  */\n25. public final class JsonIOException extends JsonParseException {\n26.   private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;\n27. \n28.   public JsonIOException(String msg) {\n29.     super(msg);\n30.   }\n31. \n32.   public JsonIOException(String msg, Throwable cause) {\n33.     super(msg, cause);\n34.   }\n35. \n36.   /**\n37.    * Creates exception with the specified cause.

Do NOT explore for more context in the codebase!\n\nAnalyzer agent has analyzed the issue and provided instruction on the issue:\n--- BEGIN ANALYZER MESSAGE ---\nBelow is a structured, high-level plan to implement the requested improvements to default ProGuard/R8 rules and the Troubleshooting Guide, and to adjust runtime messaging to better cover R8 behaviors observed with Android/Kotlin.\n\n1. Feature Understanding\n\n- Desired functionality and requirements:\n  - Strengthen the default consumer ProGuard/R8 rules shipped with Gson to reduce or eliminate R8-induced issues where classes are made abstract and/or constructors are removed, leading to JsonIOException: “Abstract classes can’t be instantiated!” during deserialization.\n  - Update the Troubleshooting Guide to recommend rules that better match real-world Android/Kotlin usage:\n    - Prefer keeping all constructors rather than only the no-args constructor, to avoid R8 making the class abstract.\n    - Clarify trade-offs when classes don’t have a no-args constructor (e.g., Kotlin primary constructor), and how this interacts with Gson’s use of JDK Unsafe and GsonBuilder.disableJdkUnsafe().\n    - Recommend Android’s @Keep annotation as a simpler alternative for app developers.\n  - Adjust runtime exception messaging to include Troubleshooting Guide URLs even when R8 makes a class abstract but constructors are still present (so that users see actionable guidance in more cases).\n- Ambiguities and edge cases to clarify in documentation:\n  - Gson does not invoke parameterized constructors by default; keeping all constructors helps prevent R8 from abstracting/removing them, but it does not change how Gson instantiates objects. If a class has no no-args constructor, Gson will typically use Unsafe unless disabled (disableJdkUnsafe()). Document this explicitly.\n  - Using -keep vs -keepclassmembers: -keep may over-preserve complete classes (size/obfuscation impact). For consumer rules, prefer narrower rules that target only relevant classes (e.g., classes with Gson annotations).\n  - Annotations scope: reflect that Gson supports @SerializedName on fields and rejects it on accessor methods; rules should focus on field- and type-level annotations, not method annotations.\n  - R8 behavior differences: sometimes classes are abstract but constructors still exist. Runtime messaging should handle this uniformly.\n\n2. Architecture Analysis\n\n- Files/modules to create or modify:\n  - gson/src/main/resources/META-INF/proguard/gson.pro\n    - Augment default consumer rules to keep constructors for classes likely to be used with Gson (e.g., classes having Gson annotations).\n  - Troubleshooting.md\n    - Update the “Abstract classes can’t be instantiated!” section to recommend better rules and discuss Kotlin/JDK Unsafe.\n    - Add guidance for @Keep annotation usage on Android.\n    - Cross-reference related sections (default field values missing, disableJdkUnsafe).\n  - examples/android-proguard-example/README.md\n    - Highlight that newer Gson versions include consumer rules by default; add examples of @Keep and revised rule guidance.\n  - gson/src/main/java/com/google/gson/internal/ConstructorConstructor.java\n    - Update the abstract-class instantiation check to always include a Troubleshooting Guide URL, even when constructors exist, to provide users a direct path to fixes.\n- Integration points and conventions:\n  - The consumer rules are applied automatically by Android builds that support consumer ProGuard configs via META-INF/proguard/*.pro in the dependency.\n  - TroubleshootingGuide.createUrl(...) is already used in ConstructorConstructor; leverage it to add links consistently.\n  - Keep consistency with existing doc anchors and styles in Troubleshooting.md.\n  - Avoid changing Gson’s instantiation behavior; only improve messaging and docs.\n\n3. Implementation Plan\n\n- Change 1: Strengthen consumer ProGuard/R8 rules\n  - File: gson/src/main/resources/META-INF/proguard/gson.pro\n  - Additions:\n    - Introduce rules that keep constructors for classes likely used with Gson based on presence of Gson annotations on fields or types. Specifically target:\n      - com.google.gson.annotations.SerializedName (on fields)\n      - com.google.gson.annotations.Expose (on fields)\n      - com.google.gson.annotations.JsonAdapter (on types and fields)\n      - com.google.gson.annotations.Since (on fields and types)\n      - com.google.gson.annotations.Until (on fields and types)\n    - Use rules that both prevent classes from being made abstract and preserve constructors. Prefer -keepclasseswithmembers matching:\n      - classes where fields are annotated with these Gson annotations, and\n      - classes where type-level annotations apply (JsonAdapter, Since, Until).\n    - Keep all constructors <init>(...) for matched classes (not just the no-args constructor) to mitigate R8’s “abstract class” optimization.\n    - Optional: If supported reliably by target shrinkers, add -if rules as a complement to select classes with these annotations and keep constructors; however, ensure the baseline behavior works without -if (some users run older versions). The baseline should rely on -keepclasseswithmembers to avoid the abstracting/removal behavior.\n    - Do not keep methods or fields broadly; focus the rules narrowly to reduce size impact and maintain obfuscation elsewhere.\n  - Why this integrates correctly:\n    - The consumer rules apply automatically to Android builds, reducing the need for app developers to manually configure ProGuard/R8.\n    - Targeting only annotated classes limits the scope to classes demonstrably used with Gson, minimizing over-preservation.\n\n- Change 2: Update Troubleshooting Guide for R8/Kotlin/Android\n  - File: Troubleshooting.md\n  - Section updates:\n    - Section id “r8-abstract-class”:\n      - Replace the “keep only no-args constructor” recommendation with guidance to keep all constructors of the affected class (<init>(...);) to prevent R8 abstracting/removing them. Explain that Gson does not call parameterized constructors by default; this rule mainly prevents R8-induced abstracting/removal.\n      - Add a sub-note for Kotlin classes without a no-args constructor:\n        - Explain that Gson will use JDK Unsafe when no no-args constructor exists (unless disableJdkUnsafe() is used), and that keeping constructors does not make Gson call them. Point to InstanceCreator or custom TypeAdapter if constructor invocation is needed.\n        - Mention the trade-off of using GsonBuilder.disableJdkUnsafe(): if disabled, deserialization will fail for classes without a no-args constructor; include link to that builder option in javadoc.\n      - Clarify -keep vs -keepclassmembers behavior and recommend -keepclasseswithmembers as the safer, narrower consumer rule approach; -keep may be used by app developers for specific classes if they prefer broad preservation.\n      - Recommend Android’s @Keep annotation for simpler per-class or per-constructor preservation (include link to developer.android.com’s @Keep documentation). Explain this as an alternative to rule configuration.\n      - Mention retracing guidance when class names are obfuscated (leave existing links intact).\n    - Cross-link to “default-field-values-missing” to reinforce how constructors and Unsafe behavior affect initialization.\n  - Maintain anchor IDs and style consistency.\n\n- Change 3: Update Android example documentation\n  - File: examples/android-proguard-example/README.md\n  - Additions:\n    - Note that recent Gson versions ship consumer rules automatically; app developers may need minimal additional configuration.\n    - Show guidance to annotate classes or constructors with @Keep for simpler control on Android, and explain when to prefer this over manual rules.\n    - Mention that for Kotlin classes without no-args constructors, keeping all constructors helps prevent R8 abstracting/removing, but Gson won’t invoke those constructors; recommend InstanceCreator or TypeAdapter if needed.\n\n- Change 4: Improve runtime messaging for abstract class cases\n  - File: gson/src/main/java/com/google/gson/internal/ConstructorConstructor.java\n  - Method: checkInstantiable(Class<?> c)\n  - Adjustment:\n    - Currently, the Troubleshooting Guide URL is appended only if the class is abstract and has zero declared constructors.\n    - Modify the logic to always include the Troubleshooting Guide URL for abstract classes (both when constructors are absent and when constructors are present), because the underlying user issue (R8 optimization or actual abstract type usage) is the same from a user’s perspective and the Guide provides actionable fixes.\n    - Keep the specific messages for interfaces and genuine abstract classes, but append TroubleshootingGuide.createUrl("r8-abstract-class") consistently in the abstract branch.\n  - Why this integrates correctly:\n    - Uses existing TroubleshootingGuide.createUrl and preserves backward compatibility while making exceptions more helpful.\n    - Avoids reliance on constructor count that varies across R8 behaviors; users receive consistent guidance.\n\n4. Considerations\n\n- Potential impacts on existing functionality:\n  - Consumer rules:\n    - Keeping constructors for annotated classes slightly reduces shrinking potential for those classes. The scope is constrained by annotations, reducing impact size-wise and preserving obfuscation for non-Gson classes.\n    - Avoids changing Gson’s runtime instantiation logic; no behavioral changes to Gson’s deserialization internals beyond improved exception messages.\n  - Documentation:\n    - Updated recommendations may change developer expectations; ensure clarity around Unsafe use and no-args constructor requirements.\n- Backward compatibility:\n  - Ensure added consumer rules use ProGuard/R8 directives available on commonly used versions. Favor -keepclasseswithmembers, which is widely supported. If adding -if rules, ensure baseline behavior does not depend on -if so older tools still benefit.\n  - Exception message changes maintain the same class of exception and only add more guidance; no API changes.\n- Dependencies or prerequisites:\n  - The effectiveness of consumer rules depends on the Android Gradle Plugin and R8/ProGuard versions used by app developers. Document that users should keep these up-to-date.\n  - If -if rules are included, note they require a reasonably recent shrinker; otherwise, document fallback behavior powered by -keepclasseswithmembers.\n- Testing and validation (recommended):\n  - Extend the existing R8 integration test(s) to cover:\n    - Classes with @SerializedName/@Expose/etc. annotated fields and verify constructors are preserved and classes are not abstracted.\n    - Kotlin data-class style types without no-args constructors to ensure consumer rules prevent abstracting/removal and to confirm runtime messaging includes the Troubleshooting link even when constructors exist.\n  - Verify exception messages include the Troubleshooting URL for abstract classes under both observed R8 behaviors (zero or non-zero declared constructors).\n\nThis plan focuses changes on consumer ProGuard/R8 rules and documentation, along with a small, targeted change to exception messaging, to reduce Android/R8 friction for Gson users without altering Gson’s core instantiation behavior.\n--- END ANALYZER MESSAGE ---\n\nIMPORTANT INSTRUCTION:\n- The context provided above should be sufficient for you to make the required code edits.

-# Troubleshooting Guide

-## <a id="class-cast-exception"></a> `ClassCastException` when using deserialized object
-
-**Symptom:** `ClassCastException` is thrown when accessing an object deserialized by Gson
-
-**Reason:** Your code is most likely not type-safe
-
-**Solution:** Make sure your code adheres to the following:
-
-- Avoid raw types: Instead of calling `fromJson(..., List.class)`, create for example a `TypeToken<List<MyClass>>`.
-  See the [user guide](UserGuide.md#collections-examples) for more information.
-- When using `TypeToken` prefer the `Gson.fromJson` overloads with `TypeToken` parameter such as [`fromJson(Reader, TypeToken)`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/Gson.html#fromJson(java.io.Reader,com.google.gson.reflect.TypeToken)).
-  The overloads with `Type` parameter do not provide any type-safety guarantees.
-- When using `TypeToken` make sure you don't capture a type variable. For example avoid something like `new TypeToken<List<T>>()` (where `T` is a type variable). Due to Java type erasure the actual type of `T` is not available at runtime. Refactor your code to pass around `TypeToken` instances or use [`TypeToken.getParameterized(...)`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/reflect/TypeToken.html#getParameterized(java.lang.reflect.Type,java.lang.reflect.Type...)), for example `TypeToken.getParameterized(List.class, elementClass)`.

-## <a id="reflection-inaccessible"></a> `InaccessibleObjectException`: 'module ... does not "opens ..." to unnamed module'
-
-**Symptom:** An exception with a message in the form 'module ... does not "opens ..." to unnamed module' is thrown
-
-**Reason:** You use Gson by accident to access internal fields of third-party classes
-
-**Solution:** Write custom Gson [`TypeAdapter`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html) implementations for the affected classes or change the type of your data. If this occurs for a field in one of your classes which you did not actually want to serialize or deserialize in the first place, you can exclude that field, see the [user guide](UserGuide.md#excluding-fields-from-serialization-and-deserialization).
-
-**Explanation:**
-
-When no built-in adapter for a type exists and no custom adapter has been registered, Gson falls back to using reflection to access the fields of a class (including `private` ones). Most likely you are seeing this error because you (by accident) rely on the reflection-based adapter for third-party classes. That should be avoided because you make yourself dependent on the implementation details of these classes which could change at any point. For the JDK it is also not possible anymore to access internal fields using reflection starting with JDK 17, see [JEP 403](https://openjdk.org/jeps/403).
-
-If you want to prevent using reflection on third-party classes in the future you can write your own [`ReflectionAccessFilter`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/ReflectionAccessFilter.html) or use one of the predefined ones, such as `ReflectionAccessFilter.BLOCK_ALL_PLATFORM`.
-
-## <a id="reflection-inaccessible-to-module-gson"></a> `InaccessibleObjectException`: 'module ... does not "opens ..." to module com.google.gson'
-
-**Symptom:** An exception with a message in the form 'module ... does not "opens ..." to module com.google.gson' is thrown
-
-**Reason:**
-
-- If the reported package is your own package then you have not configured the module declaration of your project to allow Gson to use reflection on your classes.
-- If the reported package is from a third party library or the JDK see [this troubleshooting point](#inaccessibleobjectexception-module--does-not-opens--to-unnamed-module).
-
-**Solution:** Make sure the `module-info.java` file of your project allows Gson to use reflection on your classes, for example:
-
-```java
-module mymodule {
-    requires com.google.gson;
-
-    opens mypackage to com.google.gson;
-}
-```
-
-Or in case this occurs for a field in one of your classes which you did not actually want to serialize or deserialize in the first place, you can exclude that field, see the [user guide](UserGuide.md#excluding-fields-from-serialization-and-deserialization).
-
-## <a id="android-app-random-names"></a> Android app not working in Release mode; random property names
-
-**Symptom:** Your Android app is working fine in Debug mode but fails in Release mode and the JSON properties have seemingly random names such as `a`, `b`, ...
-
-**Reason:** You probably have not configured ProGuard / R8 correctly
-
-**Solution:** Make sure you have configured ProGuard / R8 correctly to preserve the names of your fields. See the [Android example](examples/android-proguard-example/README.md) for more information.
-
-## <a id="android-app-broken-after-app-update"></a> Android app unable to parse JSON after app update
-
-**Symptom:** You released a new version of your Android app and it fails to parse JSON data created by the previous version of your app
-
-**Reason:** You probably have not configured ProGuard / R8 correctly; probably the fields names are being obfuscated and their naming changed between the versions of your app
-
-**Solution:** Make sure you have configured ProGuard / R8 correctly to preserve the names of your fields. See the [Android example](examples/android-proguard-example/README.md) for more information.
-
-If you want to preserve backward compatibility for you app you can use [`@SerializedName`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/annotations/SerializedName.html) on the fields to specify the obfuscated name as alternate, for example: `@SerializedName(value = "myprop", alternate = "a")`
-
-Normally ProGuard and R8 produce a mapping file, this makes it easier to find out the obfuscated field names instead of having to find them out through trial and error or other means. See the [Android Studio user guide](https://developer.android.com/studio/build/shrink-code.html#retracing) for more information.
-
-## <a id="default-field-values-missing"></a> Default field values not present after deserialization
-
-**Symptom:** You have assign default values to fields but after deserialization the fields have their standard value (such as `null` or `0`)
-
-**Reason:** Gson cannot invoke the constructor of your class and falls back to JDK `Unsafe` (or similar means)
-
-**Solution:** Make sure that the class:
-
-- is `static` (explicitly or implicitly when it is a top-level class)
-- has a no-args constructor
-
-Otherwise Gson will by default try to use JDK `Unsafe` or similar means to create an instance of your class without invoking the constructor and without running any initializers. You can also disable that behavior through [`GsonBuilder.disableJdkUnsafe()`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.html#disableJdkUnsafe()) to notice such issues early on.
-
-## <a id="anonymous-local-null"></a> `null` values for anonymous and local classes
-
-**Symptom:** Objects of a class are always serialized as JSON `null` / always deserialized as Java `null`
-
-**Reason:** The class you are serializing or deserializing is an anonymous or a local class (or you have specified a custom `ExclusionStrategy`)
-
-**Solution:** Convert the class to a `static` nested class. If the class is already `static` make sure you have not specified a Gson `ExclusionStrategy` which might exclude the class.
-
-Notes:
-
-- "double brace-initialization" also creates anonymous classes
-- Local record classes (feature added in Java 16) are supported by Gson and are not affected by this
-
-## <a id="map-key-wrong-json"></a> Map keys having unexpected format in JSON
-
-**Symptom:** JSON output for `Map` keys is unexpected / cannot be deserialized again
-
-**Reason:** The `Map` key type is 'complex' and you have not configured the `GsonBuilder` properly
-
-**Solution:** Use [`GsonBuilder.enableComplexMapKeySerialization()`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.html#enableComplexMapKeySerialization()). See also the [user guide](UserGuide.md#maps-examples) for more information.
-
-## <a id="malformed-json"></a> Parsing JSON fails with `MalformedJsonException`
-
-**Symptom:** JSON parsing fails with `MalformedJsonException`
-
-**Reason:** The JSON data is actually malformed
-
-**Solution:** During debugging, log the JSON data right before calling Gson methods or set a breakpoint to inspect the data and make sure it has the expected format. Sometimes APIs might return HTML error pages (instead of JSON data) when reaching rate limits or when other errors occur. Also read the location information of the `MalformedJsonException` exception message, it indicates where exactly in the document the malformed data was detected, including the [JSONPath](https://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/).
-
-For example, let's assume you want to deserialize the following JSON data:
-
-```json
-{
-  "languages": [
-    "English",
-    "French",
-  ]
-}
-```
-
-This will fail with an exception similar to this one: `MalformedJsonException: Use JsonReader.setLenient(true) to accept malformed JSON at line 5 column 4 path $.languages[2]`  
-The problem here is the trailing comma (`,`) after `"French"`, trailing commas are not allowed by the JSON specification. The location information "line 5 column 4" points to the `]` in the JSON data (with some slight inaccuracies) because Gson expected another value after `,` instead of the closing `]`. The JSONPath `$.languages[2]` in the exception message also points there: `$.` refers to the root object, `languages` refers to its member of that name and `[2]` refers to the (missing) third value in the JSON array value of that member (numbering starts at 0, so it is `[2]` instead of `[3]`).  
-The proper solution here is to fix the malformed JSON data.
-
-To spot syntax errors in the JSON data easily you can open it in an editor with support for JSON, for example Visual Studio Code. It will highlight within the JSON data the error location and show why the JSON data is considered invalid.
-
-## <a id="number-parsed-as-double"></a> Integral JSON number is parsed as `double`
-
-**Symptom:** JSON data contains an integral number such as `45` but Gson returns it as `double`
-
-**Reason:** When parsing a JSON number as `Object`, Gson will by default create always return a `double`
-
-**Solution:** Use [`GsonBuilder.setObjectToNumberStrategy`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.html#setObjectToNumberStrategy(com.google.gson.ToNumberStrategy)) to specify what type of number should be returned
-
-## <a id="default-lenient"></a> Malformed JSON not rejected
-
-**Symptom:** Gson parses malformed JSON without throwing any exceptions
-
-**Reason:** Due to legacy reasons Gson performs parsing by default in lenient mode
-
-**Solution:** See [`Gson` class documentation](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/Gson.html#default-lenient) section "Lenient JSON handling"
-
-Note: Even in non-lenient mode Gson deviates slightly from the JSON specification, see [`JsonReader.setLenient`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/stream/JsonReader.html#setLenient(boolean)) for more details.
-
-## <a id="unexpected-json-structure"></a> `IllegalStateException`: "Expected ... but was ..."
-
-**Symptom:** An `IllegalStateException` with a message in the form "Expected ... but was ..." is thrown
-
-**Reason:** The JSON data does not have the correct format
-
-**Solution:** Make sure that your classes correctly model the JSON data. Also during debugging log the JSON data right before calling Gson methods or set a breakpoint to inspect the data and make sure it has the expected format. Read the location information of the exception message, it indicates where exactly in the document the error occurred, including the [JSONPath](https://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/).
-
-For example, let's assume you have the following Java class:
-
-```java
-class WebPage {
-    String languages;
-}
-```
-
-And you want to deserialize the following JSON data:
-
-```json
-{
-  "languages": ["English", "French"]
-}
-```
-
-This will fail with an exception similar to this one: `IllegalStateException: Expected a string but was BEGIN_ARRAY at line 2 column 17 path $.languages`  
-This means Gson expected a JSON string value but found the beginning of a JSON array (`[`). The location information "line 2 column 17" points to the `[` in the JSON data (with some slight inaccuracies), so does the JSONPath `$.languages` in the exception message. It refers to the `languages` member of the root object (`$.`).  
-The solution here is to change in the `WebPage` class the field `String languages` to `List<String> languages`.
-
-## <a id="adapter-not-null-safe"></a> `IllegalStateException`: "Expected ... but was NULL"
-
-**Symptom:** An `IllegalStateException` with a message in the form "Expected ... but was NULL" is thrown
-
-**Reason:**
-
-- A built-in adapter does not support JSON null values
-- You have written a custom `TypeAdapter` which does not properly handle JSON null values
-
-**Solution:** If this occurs for a custom adapter you wrote, add code similar to the following at the beginning of its `read` method:
-
-```java
-@Override
-public MyClass read(JsonReader in) throws IOException {
-    if (in.peek() == JsonToken.NULL) {
-        in.nextNull();
-        return null;
-    }
-
-    ...
-}
-```
-
-Alternatively you can call [`nullSafe()`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html#nullSafe()) on the adapter instance you created.
-
-## <a id="serialize-nulls"></a> Properties missing in JSON
-
-**Symptom:** Properties are missing in the JSON output
-
-**Reason:** Gson by default omits JSON null from the output (or: ProGuard / R8 is not configured correctly and removed unused fields)
-
-**Solution:** Use [`GsonBuilder.serializeNulls()`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.html#serializeNulls())
-
-Note: Gson does not support anonymous and local classes and will serialize them as JSON null, see the [related troubleshooting point](#null-values-for-anonymous-and-local-classes).
-
-## <a id="android-internal-fields"></a> JSON output changes for newer Android versions
-
-**Symptom:** The JSON output differs when running on newer Android versions
-
-**Reason:** You use Gson by accident to access internal fields of Android classes
-
-**Solution:** Write custom Gson [`TypeAdapter`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html) implementations for the affected classes or change the type of your data
-
-**Explanation:**
-
-When no built-in adapter for a type exists and no custom adapter has been registered, Gson falls back to using reflection to access the fields of a class (including `private` ones). Most likely you are experiencing this issue because you (by accident) rely on the reflection-based adapter for Android classes. That should be avoided because you make yourself dependent on the implementation details of these classes which could change at any point.
-
-If you want to prevent using reflection on third-party classes in the future you can write your own [`ReflectionAccessFilter`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/ReflectionAccessFilter.html) or use one of the predefined ones, such as `ReflectionAccessFilter.BLOCK_ALL_PLATFORM`.
-
-## <a id="json-static-fields"></a> JSON output contains values of `static` fields
-
-**Symptom:** The JSON output contains values of `static` fields
-
-**Reason:** You used `GsonBuilder.excludeFieldsWithModifiers` to overwrite the default excluded modifiers
-
-**Solution:** When calling `GsonBuilder.excludeFieldsWithModifiers` you overwrite the default excluded modifiers. Therefore, you have to explicitly exclude `static` fields if desired. This can be done by adding `Modifier.STATIC` as additional argument.
-
-## <a id="no-such-method-error"></a> `NoSuchMethodError` when calling Gson methods
-
-**Symptom:** A `java.lang.NoSuchMethodError` is thrown when trying to call certain Gson methods
-
-**Reason:**
-
-- You have multiple versions of Gson on your classpath
-- Or, the Gson version you compiled against is different from the one on your classpath
-- Or, you are using a code shrinking tool such as ProGuard or R8 which removed methods from Gson
-
-**Solution:** First disable any code shrinking tools such as ProGuard or R8 and check if the issue persists. If not, you have to tweak the configuration of that tool to not modify Gson classes. Otherwise verify that the Gson JAR on your classpath is the same you are compiling against, and that there is only one Gson JAR on your classpath. See [this Stack Overflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/q/227486) to find out where a class is loaded from. For example, for debugging you could include the following code:
-
-```java
-System.out.println(Gson.class.getProtectionDomain().getCodeSource().getLocation());
-```
-
-If that fails with a `NullPointerException` you have to try one of the other ways to find out where a class is loaded from.
-
-## <a id="duplicate-fields"></a> `IllegalArgumentException`: 'Class ... declares multiple JSON fields named '...''
-
-**Symptom:** An exception with the message 'Class ... declares multiple JSON fields named '...'' is thrown
-
-**Reason:**
-
-- The name you have specified with a [`@SerializedName`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/annotations/SerializedName.html) annotation for a field collides with the name of another field
-- The [`FieldNamingStrategy`](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/FieldNamingStrategy.html) you have specified produces conflicting field names
-- A field of your class has the same name as the field of a superclass
-
-Gson prevents multiple fields with the same name because during deserialization it would be ambiguous for which field the JSON data should be deserialized. For serialization it would cause the same field to appear multiple times in JSON. While the JSON specification permits this, it is likely that the application parsing the JSON data will not handle it correctly.
-
-**Solution:** First identify the fields with conflicting names based on the exception message. Then decide if you want to rename one of them using the [`@SerializedName`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/annotations/SerializedName.html) annotation, or if you want to [exclude](UserGuide.md#excluding-fields-from-serialization-and-deserialization) one of them. When excluding one of the fields you have to include it for both serialization and deserialization (even if your application only performs one of these actions) because the duplicate field check cannot differentiate between these actions.
-
-## <a id="java-lang-class-unsupported"></a> `UnsupportedOperationException` when serializing or deserializing `java.lang.Class`
-
-**Symptom:** An `UnsupportedOperationException` is thrown when trying to serialize or deserialize `java.lang.Class`
-
-**Reason:** Gson intentionally does not permit serializing and deserializing `java.lang.Class` for security reasons. Otherwise a malicious user could make your application load an arbitrary class from the classpath and, depending on what your application does with the `Class`, in the worst case perform a remote code execution attack.
-
-**Solution:** First check if you really need to serialize or deserialize a `Class`. Often it is possible to use string aliases and then map them to the known `Class`; you could write a custom [`TypeAdapter`](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html) to do this. If the `Class` values are not known in advance, try to introduce a common base class or interface for all these classes and then verify that the deserialized class is a subclass. For example assuming the base class is called `MyBaseClass`, your custom `TypeAdapter` should load the class like this:
-
-```java
-Class.forName(jsonString, false, getClass().getClassLoader()).asSubclass(MyBaseClass.class)
-```
-
-This will not initialize arbitrary classes, and it will throw a `ClassCastException` if the loaded class is not the same as or a subclass of `MyBaseClass`.
-
-## <a id="type-token-raw"></a> `IllegalStateException`: 'TypeToken must be created with a type argument' <br> `RuntimeException`: 'Missing type parameter'
-
-**Symptom:** An `IllegalStateException` with the message 'TypeToken must be created with a type argument' is thrown.  
-For older Gson versions a `RuntimeException` with message 'Missing type parameter' is thrown.
-
-**Reason:**
-
-- You created a `TypeToken` without type argument, for example `new TypeToken() {}` (note the missing `<...>`). You always have to provide the type argument, for example like this: `new TypeToken<List<String>>() {}`. Normally the compiler will also emit a 'raw types' warning when you forget the `<...>`.
-- You are using a code shrinking tool such as ProGuard or R8 (Android app builds normally have this enabled by default) but have not configured it correctly for usage with Gson.
-
-**Solution:** When you are using a code shrinking tool such as ProGuard or R8 you have to adjust your configuration to include the following rules:
-
-```
-# Keep generic signatures; needed for correct type resolution
--keepattributes Signature
-
-# Keep class TypeToken (respectively its generic signature)
--keep class com.google.gson.reflect.TypeToken { *; }
-
-# Keep any (anonymous) classes extending TypeToken
--keep class * extends com.google.gson.reflect.TypeToken
-```
-
-See also the [Android example](examples/android-proguard-example/README.md) for more information.
-
-Note: For newer Gson versions these rules might be applied automatically; make sure you are using the latest Gson version and the latest version of the code shrinking tool.
-
-## <a id="r8-abstract-class"></a> `JsonIOException`: 'Abstract classes can't be instantiated!' (R8)
-
-**Symptom:** A `JsonIOException` with the message 'Abstract classes can't be instantiated!' is thrown; the class mentioned in the exception message is not actually `abstract` in your source code, and you are using the code shrinking tool R8 (Android app builds normally have this configured by default).
-
-**Reason:** The code shrinking tool R8 performs optimizations where it removes the no-args constructor from a class and makes the class `abstract`. Due to this Gson cannot create an instance of the class.
-
-**Solution:** Make sure the class has a no-args constructor, then adjust your R8 configuration file to keep the constructor of the class. For example:
-
-```
-# Keep the no-args constructor of the deserialized class
--keepclassmembers class com.example.MyClass {
-  <init>();
-}
-```
-
-For Android you can add this rule to the `proguard-rules.pro` file, see also the [Android documentation](https://developer.android.com/build/shrink-code#keep-code). In case the class name in the exception message is obfuscated, see the Android documentation about [retracing](https://developer.android.com/build/shrink-code#retracing).
-
-Note: If the class which you are trying to deserialize is actually abstract, then this exception is probably unrelated to R8 and you will have to implement a custom [`InstanceCreator`](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/InstanceCreator.html) or [`TypeAdapter`](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html) which creates an instance of a non-abstract subclass of the class.

+
+## <a id="class-cast-exception"></a> `ClassCastException` when using deserialized object
+
+**Symptom:** `ClassCastException` is thrown when accessing an object deserialized by Gson
+
+**Reason:** Your code is most likely not type-safe
+
+**Solution:** Make sure your code adheres to the following:
+
+- Avoid raw types: Instead of calling `fromJson(..., List.class)`, create for example a `TypeToken<List<MyClass>>`.
+  See the [user guide](UserGuide.md#collections-examples) for more information.
+- When using `TypeToken` prefer the `Gson.fromJson` overloads with `TypeToken` parameter such as [`fromJson(Reader, TypeToken)`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/Gson.html#fromJson(java.io.Reader,com.google.gson.reflect.TypeToken)).
+  The overloads with `Type` parameter do not provide any type-safety guarantees.
+- When using `TypeToken` make sure you don't capture a type variable. For example avoid something like `new TypeToken<List<T>>()` (where `T` is a type variable). Due to Java type erasure the actual type of `T` is not available at runtime. Refactor your code to pass around `TypeToken` instances or use [`TypeToken.getParameterized(...)`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/reflect/TypeToken.html#getParameterized(java.lang.reflect.Type,java.lang.reflect.Type...)), for example `TypeToken.getParameterized(List.class, elementClass)`.
+
+## <a id="reflection-inaccessible"></a> `InaccessibleObjectException`: 'module ... does not "opens ..." to unnamed module'
+
+**Symptom:** An exception with a message in the form 'module ... does not "opens ..." to unnamed module' is thrown
+
+**Reason:** You use Gson by accident to access internal fields of third-party classes
+
+**Solution:** Write custom Gson [`TypeAdapter`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html) implementations for the affected classes or change the type of your data. If this occurs for a field in one of your classes which you did not actually want to serialize or deserialize in the first place, you can exclude that field, see the [user guide](UserGuide.md#excluding-fields-from-serialization-and-deserialization).
+
+**Explanation:**
+
+When no built-in adapter for a type exists and no custom adapter has been registered, Gson falls back to using reflection to access the fields of a class (including `private` ones). Most likely you are seeing this error because you (by accident) rely on the reflection-based adapter for third-party classes. That should be avoided because you make yourself dependent on the implementation details of these classes which could change at any point. For the JDK it is also not possible anymore to access internal fields using reflection starting with JDK 17, see [JEP 403](https://openjdk.org/jeps/403).
+
+If you want to prevent using reflection on third-party classes in the future you can write your own [`ReflectionAccessFilter`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/ReflectionAccessFilter.html) or use one of the predefined ones, such as `ReflectionAccessFilter.BLOCK_ALL_PLATFORM`.
+
+## <a id="reflection-inaccessible-to-module-gson"></a> `InaccessibleObjectException`: 'module ... does not "opens ..." to module com.google.gson'
+
+**Symptom:** An exception with a message in the form 'module ... does not "opens ..." to module com.google.gson' is thrown
+
+**Reason:**
+
+- If the reported package is your own package then you have not configured the module declaration of your project to allow Gson to use reflection on your classes.
+- If the reported package is from a third party library or the JDK see [this troubleshooting point](#inaccessibleobjectexception-module--does-not-opens--to-unnamed-module).
+
+**Solution:** Make sure the `module-info.java` file of your project allows Gson to use reflection on your classes, for example:
+
+```java
+module mymodule {
+    requires com.google.gson;
+
+    opens mypackage to com.google.gson;
+}
+```
+
+Or in case this occurs for a field in one of your classes which you did not actually want to serialize or deserialize in the first place, you can exclude that field, see the [user guide](UserGuide.md#excluding-fields-from-serialization-and-deserialization).
+
+## <a id="android-app-random-names"></a> Android app not working in Release mode; random property names
+
+**Symptom:** Your Android app is working fine in Debug mode but fails in Release mode and the JSON properties have seemingly random names such as `a`, `b`, ...
+
+**Reason:** You probably have not configured ProGuard / R8 correctly
+
+**Solution:** Make sure you have configured ProGuard / R8 correctly to preserve the names of your fields. See the [Android example](examples/android-proguard-example/README.md) for more information.
+
+## <a id="android-app-broken-after-app-update"></a> Android app unable to parse JSON after app update
+
+**Symptom:** You released a new version of your Android app and it fails to parse JSON data created by the previous version of your app
+
+**Reason:** You probably have not configured ProGuard / R8 correctly; probably the fields names are being obfuscated and their naming changed between the versions of your app
+
+**Solution:** Make sure you have configured ProGuard / R8 correctly to preserve the names of your fields. See the [Android example](examples/android-proguard-example/README.md) for more information.
+
+If you want to preserve backward compatibility for you app you can use [`@SerializedName`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/annotations/SerializedName.html) on the fields to specify the obfuscated name as alternate, for example: `@SerializedName(value = "myprop", alternate = "a")`
+
+Normally ProGuard and R8 produce a mapping file, this makes it easier to find out the obfuscated field names instead of having to find them out through trial and error or other means. See the [Android Studio user guide](https://developer.android.com/studio/build/shrink-code.html#retracing) for more information.
+
+## <a id="default-field-values-missing"></a> Default field values not present after deserialization
+
+**Symptom:** You have assign default values to fields but after deserialization the fields have their standard value (such as `null` or `0`)
+
+**Reason:** Gson cannot invoke the constructor of your class and falls back to JDK `Unsafe` (or similar means)
+
+**Solution:** Make sure that the class:
+
+- is `static` (explicitly or implicitly when it is a top-level class)
+- has a no-args constructor
+
+Otherwise Gson will by default try to use JDK `Unsafe` or similar means to create an instance of your class without invoking the constructor and without running any initializers. You can also disable that behavior through [`GsonBuilder.disableJdkUnsafe()`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.html#disableJdkUnsafe()) to notice such issues early on.
+
+## <a id="anonymous-local-null"></a> `null` values for anonymous and local classes
+
+**Symptom:** Objects of a class are always serialized as JSON `null` / always deserialized as Java `null`
+
+**Reason:** The class you are serializing or deserializing is an anonymous or a local class (or you have specified a custom `ExclusionStrategy`)
+
+**Solution:** Convert the class to a `static` nested class. If the class is already `static` make sure you have not specified a Gson `ExclusionStrategy` which might exclude the class.
+
+Notes:
+
+- "double brace-initialization" also creates anonymous classes
+- Local record classes (feature added in Java 16) are supported by Gson and are not affected by this
+
+## <a id="map-key-wrong-json"></a> Map keys having unexpected format in JSON
+
+**Symptom:** JSON output for `Map` keys is unexpected / cannot be deserialized again
+
+**Reason:** The `Map` key type is 'complex' and you have not configured the `GsonBuilder` properly
+
+**Solution:** Use [`GsonBuilder.enableComplexMapKeySerialization()`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.html#enableComplexMapKeySerialization()). See also the [user guide](UserGuide.md#maps-examples) for more information.
+
+## <a id="malformed-json"></a> Parsing JSON fails with `MalformedJsonException`
+
+**Symptom:** JSON parsing fails with `MalformedJsonException`
+
+**Reason:** The JSON data is actually malformed
+
+**Solution:** During debugging, log the JSON data right before calling Gson methods or set a breakpoint to inspect the data and make sure it has the expected format. Sometimes APIs might return HTML error pages (instead of JSON data) when reaching rate limits or when other errors occur. Also read the location information of the `MalformedJsonException` exception message, it indicates where exactly in the document the malformed data was detected, including the [JSONPath](https://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/).
+
+For example, let's assume you want to deserialize the following JSON data:
+
+```json
+{
+  "languages": [
+    "English",
+    "French",
+  ]
+}
+```
+
+This will fail with an exception similar to this one: `MalformedJsonException: Use JsonReader.setLenient(true) to accept malformed JSON at line 5 column 4 path $.languages[2]`  
+The problem here is the trailing comma (`,`) after `"French"`, trailing commas are not allowed by the JSON specification. The location information "line 5 column 4" points to the `]` in the JSON data (with some slight inaccuracies) because Gson expected another value after `,` instead of the closing `]`. The JSONPath `$.languages[2]` in the exception message also points there: `$.` refers to the root object, `languages` refers to its member of that name and `[2]` refers to the (missing) third value in the JSON array value of that member (numbering starts at 0, so it is `[2]` instead of `[3]`).  
+The proper solution here is to fix the malformed JSON data.
+
+To spot syntax errors in the JSON data easily you can open it in an editor with support for JSON, for example Visual Studio Code. It will highlight within the JSON data the error location and show why the JSON data is considered invalid.
+
+## <a id="number-parsed-as-double"></a> Integral JSON number is parsed as `double`
+
+**Symptom:** JSON data contains an integral number such as `45` but Gson returns it as `double`
+
+**Reason:** When parsing a JSON number as `Object`, Gson will by default create always return a `double`
+
+**Solution:** Use [`GsonBuilder.setObjectToNumberStrategy`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.html#setObjectToNumberStrategy(com.google.gson.ToNumberStrategy)) to specify what type of number should be returned
+
+## <a id="default-lenient"></a> Malformed JSON not rejected
+
+**Symptom:** Gson parses malformed JSON without throwing any exceptions
+
+**Reason:** Due to legacy reasons Gson performs parsing by default in lenient mode
+
+**Solution:** See [`Gson` class documentation](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/Gson.html#default-lenient) section "Lenient JSON handling"
+
+Note: Even in non-lenient mode Gson deviates slightly from the JSON specification, see [`JsonReader.setLenient`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/stream/JsonReader.html#setLenient(boolean)) for more details.
+
+## <a id="unexpected-json-structure"></a> `IllegalStateException`: "Expected ... but was ..."
+
+**Symptom:** An `IllegalStateException` with a message in the form "Expected ... but was ..." is thrown
+
+**Reason:** The JSON data does not have the correct format
+
+**Solution:** Make sure that your classes correctly model the JSON data. Also during debugging log the JSON data right before calling Gson methods or set a breakpoint to inspect the data and make sure it has the expected format. Read the location information of the exception message, it indicates where exactly in the document the error occurred, including the [JSONPath](https://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/).
+
+For example, let's assume you have the following Java class:
+
+```java
+class WebPage {
+    String languages;
+}
+```
+
+And you want to deserialize the following JSON data:
+
+```json
+{
+  "languages": ["English", "French"]
+}
+```
+
+This will fail with an exception similar to this one: `IllegalStateException: Expected a string but was BEGIN_ARRAY at line 2 column 17 path $.languages`  
+This means Gson expected a JSON string value but found the beginning of a JSON array (`[`). The location information "line 2 column 17" points to the `[` in the JSON data (with some slight inaccuracies), so does the JSONPath `$.languages` in the exception message. It refers to the `languages` member of the root object (`$.`).  
+The solution here is to change in the `WebPage` class the field `String languages` to `List<String> languages`.
+
+## <a id="adapter-not-null-safe"></a> `IllegalStateException`: "Expected ... but was NULL"
+
+**Symptom:** An `IllegalStateException` with a message in the form "Expected ... but was NULL" is thrown
+
+**Reason:**
+
+- A built-in adapter does not support JSON null values
+- You have written a custom `TypeAdapter` which does not properly handle JSON null values
+
+**Solution:** If this occurs for a custom adapter you wrote, add code similar to the following at the beginning of its `read` method:
+
+```java
+@Override
+public MyClass read(JsonReader in) throws IOException {
+    if (in.peek() == JsonToken.NULL) {
+        in.nextNull();
+        return null;
+    }
+
+    ...
+}
+```
+
+Alternatively you can call [`nullSafe()`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html#nullSafe()) on the adapter instance you created.
+
+## <a id="serialize-nulls"></a> Properties missing in JSON
+
+**Symptom:** Properties are missing in the JSON output
+
+**Reason:** Gson by default omits JSON null from the output (or: ProGuard / R8 is not configured correctly and removed unused fields)
+
+**Solution:** Use [`GsonBuilder.serializeNulls()`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.html#serializeNulls())
+
+Note: Gson does not support anonymous and local classes and will serialize them as JSON null, see the [related troubleshooting point](#null-values-for-anonymous-and-local-classes).
+
+## <a id="android-internal-fields"></a> JSON output changes for newer Android versions
+
+**Symptom:** The JSON output differs when running on newer Android versions
+
+**Reason:** You use Gson by accident to access internal fields of Android classes
+
+**Solution:** Write custom Gson [`TypeAdapter`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html) implementations for the affected classes or change the type of your data
+
+**Explanation:**

+
+## <a id="json-static-fields"></a> JSON output contains values of `static` fields
+
+**Symptom:** The JSON output contains values of `static` fields
+
+**Reason:** You used `GsonBuilder.excludeFieldsWithModifiers` to overwrite the default excluded modifiers
+
+**Solution:** When calling `GsonBuilder.excludeFieldsWithModifiers` you overwrite the default excluded modifiers. Therefore, you have to explicitly exclude `static` fields if desired. This can be done by adding `Modifier.STATIC` as additional argument.
+
+## <a id="no-such-method-error"></a> `NoSuchMethodError` when calling Gson methods
+
+**Symptom:** A `java.lang.NoSuchMethodError` is thrown when trying to call certain Gson methods
+
+**Reason:**
+
+- You have multiple versions of Gson on your classpath
+- Or, the Gson version you compiled against is different from the one on your classpath
+- Or, you are using a code shrinking tool such as ProGuard or R8 which removed methods from Gson
+
+**Solution:** First disable any code shrinking tools such as ProGuard or R8 and check if the issue persists. If not, you have to tweak the configuration of that tool to not modify Gson classes. Otherwise verify that the Gson JAR on your classpath is the same you are compiling against, and that there is only one Gson JAR on your classpath. See [this Stack Overflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/q/227486) to find out where a class is loaded from. For example, for debugging you could include the following code:
+
+```java
+System.out.println(Gson.class.getProtectionDomain().getCodeSource().getLocation());
+```
+
+If that fails with a `NullPointerException` you have to try one of the other ways to find out where a class is loaded from.
+
+## <a id="duplicate-fields"></a> `IllegalArgumentException`: 'Class ... declares multiple JSON fields named '...''
+
+**Symptom:** An exception with the message 'Class ... declares multiple JSON fields named '...'' is thrown
+
+**Reason:**
+
+- The name you have specified with a [`@SerializedName`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/annotations/SerializedName.html) annotation for a field collides with the name of another field
+- The [`FieldNamingStrategy`](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/FieldNamingStrategy.html) you have specified produces conflicting field names
+- A field of your class has the same name as the field of a superclass
+
+Gson prevents multiple fields with the same name because during deserialization it would be ambiguous for which field the JSON data should be deserialized. For serialization it would cause the same field to appear multiple times in JSON. While the JSON specification permits this, it is likely that the application parsing the JSON data will not handle it correctly.
+
+**Solution:** First identify the fields with conflicting names based on the exception message. Then decide if you want to rename one of them using the [`@SerializedName`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/annotations/SerializedName.html) annotation, or if you want to [exclude](UserGuide.md#excluding-fields-from-serialization-and-deserialization) one of them. When excluding one of the fields you have to include it for both serialization and deserialization (even if your application only performs one of these actions) because the duplicate field check cannot differentiate between these actions.
+
+## <a id="java-lang-class-unsupported"></a> `UnsupportedOperationException` when serializing or deserializing `java.lang.Class`
+
+**Symptom:** An `UnsupportedOperationException` is thrown when trying to serialize or deserialize `java.lang.Class`
+
+**Reason:** Gson intentionally does not permit serializing and deserializing `java.lang.Class` for security reasons. Otherwise a malicious user could make your application load an arbitrary class from the classpath and, depending on what your application does with the `Class`, in the worst case perform a remote code execution attack.
+
+**Solution:** First check if you really need to serialize or deserialize a `Class`. Often it is possible to use string aliases and then map them to the known `Class`; you could write a custom [`TypeAdapter`](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html) to do this. If the `Class` values are not known in advance, try to introduce a common base class or interface for all these classes and then verify that the deserialized class is a subclass. For example assuming the base class is called `MyBaseClass`, your custom `TypeAdapter` should load the class like this:
+
+```java
+Class.forName(jsonString, false, getClass().getClassLoader()).asSubclass(MyBaseClass.class)
+```
+
+This will not initialize arbitrary classes, and it will throw a `ClassCastException` if the loaded class is not the same as or a subclass of `MyBaseClass`.
+
+## <a id="type-token-raw"></a> `IllegalStateException`: 'TypeToken must be created with a type argument' <br> `RuntimeException`: 'Missing type parameter'
+
+**Symptom:** An `IllegalStateException` with the message 'TypeToken must be created with a type argument' is thrown.  
+For older Gson versions a `RuntimeException` with message 'Missing type parameter' is thrown.
+
+**Reason:**
+
+- You created a `TypeToken` without type argument, for example `new TypeToken() {}` (note the missing `<...>`). You always have to provide the type argument, for example like this: `new TypeToken<List<String>>() {}`. Normally the compiler will also emit a 'raw types' warning when you forget the `<...>`.
+- You are using a code shrinking tool such as ProGuard or R8 (Android app builds normally have this enabled by default) but have not configured it correctly for usage with Gson.
+
+**Solution:** When you are using a code shrinking tool such as ProGuard or R8 you have to adjust your configuration to include the following rules:
+
+```
+# Keep generic signatures; needed for correct type resolution
+-keepattributes Signature
+
+# Keep class TypeToken (respectively its generic signature)
+-keep class com.google.gson.reflect.TypeToken { *; }
+
+# Keep any (anonymous) classes extending TypeToken
+-keep class * extends com.google.gson.reflect.TypeToken
+```
+
+See also the [Android example](examples/android-proguard-example/README.md) for more information.
+
+Note: For newer Gson versions these rules might be applied automatically; make sure you are using the latest Gson version and the latest version of the code shrinking tool.
+
+## <a id="r8-abstract-class"></a> `JsonIOException`: 'Abstract classes can't be instantiated!' (R8)
+
+**Symptom:** A `JsonIOException` with the message 'Abstract classes can't be instantiated!' is thrown; the class mentioned in the exception message is not actually `abstract` in your source code, and you are using the code shrinking tool R8 (Android app builds normally have this configured by default).
+
+**Reason:** The code shrinking tool R8 performs optimizations where it may remove constructors from a class and make the class `abstract`. Due to this Gson cannot create an instance of the class.
+
+**Solution:** Adjust your R8/ProGuard configuration to keep the constructors of the affected class. Prefer keeping all constructors to prevent R8 from making the class abstract:
+
+```
+# Keep all constructors of the deserialized class
+-keepclasseswithmembers class com.example.MyClass {
+  <init>(...);
+}
+```
+
+Notes:
+
+- Gson does not invoke parameterized constructors by default. It uses a no-args constructor if available; otherwise it typically uses JDK `Unsafe` (or similar means) to create instances without calling any constructor. See also [Default field values not present after deserialization](#default-field-values-missing) and [`GsonBuilder.disableJdkUnsafe()`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.html#disableJdkUnsafe()).
+- Kotlin classes commonly have a primary constructor and no no-args constructor (e.g., `class MyClass(val s: String)`). Keeping all constructors helps prevent R8 from making such classes abstract, but Gson will still not call the parameterized constructor. If you need constructor invocation, register an [`InstanceCreator`](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/InstanceCreator.html) or a custom [`TypeAdapter`](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html).
+- If you prefer broader preservation, `-keep` can be used instead of `-keepclasseswithmembers`, but it may have a larger impact on shrinking/obfuscation.
+- On Android, you can alternatively annotate the class or specific constructors with [`@Keep`](https://developer.android.com/studio/write/annotations#keep) to prevent them from being removed.
+
+For Android you can add rules to the `proguard-rules.pro` file, see also the [Android documentation](https://developer.android.com/build/shrink-code#keep-code). In case the class name in the exception message is obfuscated, see the Android documentation about [retracing](https://developer.android.com/build/shrink-code#retracing).
+
+Note: If the class which you are trying to deserialize is actually abstract, then this exception is unrelated to R8 and you will have to implement a custom [`InstanceCreator`](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/InstanceCreator.html) or [`TypeAdapter`](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html) which creates an instance of a non-abstract subclass of the class.

-# Troubleshooting Guide
-
-This guide describes how to troubleshoot common issues when using Gson.
-
-<!-- The '<a id="..."></a>' anchors below are used to create stable links; don't remove or rename them -->

-
-## <a id="class-cast-exception"></a> `ClassCastException` when using deserialized object
-
-**Symptom:** `ClassCastException` is thrown when accessing an object deserialized by Gson
-
-**Reason:** Your code is most likely not type-safe
-
-**Solution:** Make sure your code adheres to the following:
-
-- Avoid raw types: Instead of calling `fromJson(..., List.class)`, create for example a `TypeToken<List<MyClass>>`.
-  See the [user guide](UserGuide.md#collections-examples) for more information.
-- When using `TypeToken` prefer the `Gson.fromJson` overloads with `TypeToken` parameter such as [`fromJson(Reader, TypeToken)`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/Gson.html#fromJson(java.io.Reader,com.google.gson.reflect.TypeToken)).
-  The overloads with `Type` parameter do not provide any type-safety guarantees.
-- When using `TypeToken` make sure you don't capture a type variable. For example avoid something like `new TypeToken<List<T>>()` (where `T` is a type variable). Due to Java type erasure the actual type of `T` is not available at runtime. Refactor your code to pass around `TypeToken` instances or use [`TypeToken.getParameterized(...)`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/reflect/TypeToken.html#getParameterized(java.lang.reflect.Type,java.lang.reflect.Type...)), for example `TypeToken.getParameterized(List.class, elementClass)`.
-
-## <a id="reflection-inaccessible"></a> `InaccessibleObjectException`: 'module ... does not "opens ..." to unnamed module'
-
-**Symptom:** An exception with a message in the form 'module ... does not "opens ..." to unnamed module' is thrown
-
-**Reason:** You use Gson by accident to access internal fields of third-party classes
-
-**Solution:** Write custom Gson [`TypeAdapter`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html) implementations for the affected classes or change the type of your data. If this occurs for a field in one of your classes which you did not actually want to serialize or deserialize in the first place, you can exclude that field, see the [user guide](UserGuide.md#excluding-fields-from-serialization-and-deserialization).
-
-**Explanation:**
-
-When no built-in adapter for a type exists and no custom adapter has been registered, Gson falls back to using reflection to access the fields of a class (including `private` ones). Most likely you are seeing this error because you (by accident) rely on the reflection-based adapter for third-party classes. That should be avoided because you make yourself dependent on the implementation details of these classes which could change at any point. For the JDK it is also not possible anymore to access internal fields using reflection starting with JDK 17, see [JEP 403](https://openjdk.org/jeps/403).
-
-If you want to prevent using reflection on third-party classes in the future you can write your own [`ReflectionAccessFilter`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/ReflectionAccessFilter.html) or use one of the predefined ones, such as `ReflectionAccessFilter.BLOCK_ALL_PLATFORM`.
-
-## <a id="reflection-inaccessible-to-module-gson"></a> `InaccessibleObjectException`: 'module ... does not "opens ..." to module com.google.gson'
-
-**Symptom:** An exception with a message in the form 'module ... does not "opens ..." to module com.google.gson' is thrown
-
-**Reason:**
-
-- If the reported package is your own package then you have not configured the module declaration of your project to allow Gson to use reflection on your classes.
-- If the reported package is from a third party library or the JDK see [this troubleshooting point](#inaccessibleobjectexception-module--does-not-opens--to-unnamed-module).
-
-**Solution:** Make sure the `module-info.java` file of your project allows Gson to use reflection on your classes, for example:
-
-```java
-module mymodule {
-    requires com.google.gson;
-
-    opens mypackage to com.google.gson;
-}
-```
-
-Or in case this occurs for a field in one of your classes which you did not actually want to serialize or deserialize in the first place, you can exclude that field, see the [user guide](UserGuide.md#excluding-fields-from-serialization-and-deserialization).
-
-## <a id="android-app-random-names"></a> Android app not working in Release mode; random property names
-
-**Symptom:** Your Android app is working fine in Debug mode but fails in Release mode and the JSON properties have seemingly random names such as `a`, `b`, ...
-
-**Reason:** You probably have not configured ProGuard / R8 correctly
-
-**Solution:** Make sure you have configured ProGuard / R8 correctly to preserve the names of your fields. See the [Android example](examples/android-proguard-example/README.md) for more information.
-
-## <a id="android-app-broken-after-app-update"></a> Android app unable to parse JSON after app update
-
-**Symptom:** You released a new version of your Android app and it fails to parse JSON data created by the previous version of your app
-
-**Reason:** You probably have not configured ProGuard / R8 correctly; probably the fields names are being obfuscated and their naming changed between the versions of your app
-
-**Solution:** Make sure you have configured ProGuard / R8 correctly to preserve the names of your fields. See the [Android example](examples/android-proguard-example/README.md) for more information.
-
-If you want to preserve backward compatibility for you app you can use [`@SerializedName`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/annotations/SerializedName.html) on the fields to specify the obfuscated name as alternate, for example: `@SerializedName(value = "myprop", alternate = "a")`
-
-Normally ProGuard and R8 produce a mapping file, this makes it easier to find out the obfuscated field names instead of having to find them out through trial and error or other means. See the [Android Studio user guide](https://developer.android.com/studio/build/shrink-code.html#retracing) for more information.
-
-## <a id="default-field-values-missing"></a> Default field values not present after deserialization
-
-**Symptom:** You have assign default values to fields but after deserialization the fields have their standard value (such as `null` or `0`)
-
-**Reason:** Gson cannot invoke the constructor of your class and falls back to JDK `Unsafe` (or similar means)
-
-**Solution:** Make sure that the class:
-
-- is `static` (explicitly or implicitly when it is a top-level class)
-- has a no-args constructor
-
-Otherwise Gson will by default try to use JDK `Unsafe` or similar means to create an instance of your class without invoking the constructor and without running any initializers. You can also disable that behavior through [`GsonBuilder.disableJdkUnsafe()`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.html#disableJdkUnsafe()) to notice such issues early on.
-
-## <a id="anonymous-local-null"></a> `null` values for anonymous and local classes
-
-**Symptom:** Objects of a class are always serialized as JSON `null` / always deserialized as Java `null`
-
-**Reason:** The class you are serializing or deserializing is an anonymous or a local class (or you have specified a custom `ExclusionStrategy`)
-
-**Solution:** Convert the class to a `static` nested class. If the class is already `static` make sure you have not specified a Gson `ExclusionStrategy` which might exclude the class.
-
-Notes:
-
-- "double brace-initialization" also creates anonymous classes
-- Local record classes (feature added in Java 16) are supported by Gson and are not affected by this
-
-## <a id="map-key-wrong-json"></a> Map keys having unexpected format in JSON
-
-**Symptom:** JSON output for `Map` keys is unexpected / cannot be deserialized again
-
-**Reason:** The `Map` key type is 'complex' and you have not configured the `GsonBuilder` properly
-
-**Solution:** Use [`GsonBuilder.enableComplexMapKeySerialization()`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.html#enableComplexMapKeySerialization()). See also the [user guide](UserGuide.md#maps-examples) for more information.
-
-## <a id="malformed-json"></a> Parsing JSON fails with `MalformedJsonException`
-
-**Symptom:** JSON parsing fails with `MalformedJsonException`
-
-**Reason:** The JSON data is actually malformed
-
-**Solution:** During debugging, log the JSON data right before calling Gson methods or set a breakpoint to inspect the data and make sure it has the expected format. Sometimes APIs might return HTML error pages (instead of JSON data) when reaching rate limits or when other errors occur. Also read the location information of the `MalformedJsonException` exception message, it indicates where exactly in the document the malformed data was detected, including the [JSONPath](https://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/).
-
-For example, let's assume you want to deserialize the following JSON data:
-
-```json
-{
-  "languages": [
-    "English",
-    "French",
-  ]
-}
-```
-
-This will fail with an exception similar to this one: `MalformedJsonException: Use JsonReader.setLenient(true) to accept malformed JSON at line 5 column 4 path $.languages[2]`  
-The problem here is the trailing comma (`,`) after `"French"`, trailing commas are not allowed by the JSON specification. The location information "line 5 column 4" points to the `]` in the JSON data (with some slight inaccuracies) because Gson expected another value after `,` instead of the closing `]`. The JSONPath `$.languages[2]` in the exception message also points there: `$.` refers to the root object, `languages` refers to its member of that name and `[2]` refers to the (missing) third value in the JSON array value of that member (numbering starts at 0, so it is `[2]` instead of `[3]`).  
-The proper solution here is to fix the malformed JSON data.
-
-To spot syntax errors in the JSON data easily you can open it in an editor with support for JSON, for example Visual Studio Code. It will highlight within the JSON data the error location and show why the JSON data is considered invalid.
-
-## <a id="number-parsed-as-double"></a> Integral JSON number is parsed as `double`
-
-**Symptom:** JSON data contains an integral number such as `45` but Gson returns it as `double`
-
-**Reason:** When parsing a JSON number as `Object`, Gson will by default create always return a `double`
-
-**Solution:** Use [`GsonBuilder.setObjectToNumberStrategy`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.html#setObjectToNumberStrategy(com.google.gson.ToNumberStrategy)) to specify what type of number should be returned
-
-## <a id="default-lenient"></a> Malformed JSON not rejected
-
-**Symptom:** Gson parses malformed JSON without throwing any exceptions
-
-**Reason:** Due to legacy reasons Gson performs parsing by default in lenient mode
-
-**Solution:** See [`Gson` class documentation](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/Gson.html#default-lenient) section "Lenient JSON handling"
-
-Note: Even in non-lenient mode Gson deviates slightly from the JSON specification, see [`JsonReader.setLenient`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/stream/JsonReader.html#setLenient(boolean)) for more details.
-
-## <a id="unexpected-json-structure"></a> `IllegalStateException`: "Expected ... but was ..."
-
-**Symptom:** An `IllegalStateException` with a message in the form "Expected ... but was ..." is thrown
-
-**Reason:** The JSON data does not have the correct format
-
-**Solution:** Make sure that your classes correctly model the JSON data. Also during debugging log the JSON data right before calling Gson methods or set a breakpoint to inspect the data and make sure it has the expected format. Read the location information of the exception message, it indicates where exactly in the document the error occurred, including the [JSONPath](https://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/).
-
-For example, let's assume you have the following Java class:
-
-```java
-class WebPage {
-    String languages;
-}
-```
-
-And you want to deserialize the following JSON data:
-
-```json
-{
-  "languages": ["English", "French"]
-}
-```
-
-This will fail with an exception similar to this one: `IllegalStateException: Expected a string but was BEGIN_ARRAY at line 2 column 17 path $.languages`  
-This means Gson expected a JSON string value but found the beginning of a JSON array (`[`). The location information "line 2 column 17" points to the `[` in the JSON data (with some slight inaccuracies), so does the JSONPath `$.languages` in the exception message. It refers to the `languages` member of the root object (`$.`).  
-The solution here is to change in the `WebPage` class the field `String languages` to `List<String> languages`.
-
-## <a id="adapter-not-null-safe"></a> `IllegalStateException`: "Expected ... but was NULL"
-
-**Symptom:** An `IllegalStateException` with a message in the form "Expected ... but was NULL" is thrown
-
-**Reason:**
-
-- A built-in adapter does not support JSON null values
-- You have written a custom `TypeAdapter` which does not properly handle JSON null values
-
-**Solution:** If this occurs for a custom adapter you wrote, add code similar to the following at the beginning of its `read` method:
-
-```java
-@Override
-public MyClass read(JsonReader in) throws IOException {
-    if (in.peek() == JsonToken.NULL) {
-        in.nextNull();
-        return null;
-    }
-
-    ...
-}
-```
-
-Alternatively you can call [`nullSafe()`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html#nullSafe()) on the adapter instance you created.
-
-## <a id="serialize-nulls"></a> Properties missing in JSON
-
-**Symptom:** Properties are missing in the JSON output
-
-**Reason:** Gson by default omits JSON null from the output (or: ProGuard / R8 is not configured correctly and removed unused fields)
-
-**Solution:** Use [`GsonBuilder.serializeNulls()`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.html#serializeNulls())
-
-Note: Gson does not support anonymous and local classes and will serialize them as JSON null, see the [related troubleshooting point](#null-values-for-anonymous-and-local-classes).
-
-## <a id="android-internal-fields"></a> JSON output changes for newer Android versions
-
-**Symptom:** The JSON output differs when running on newer Android versions
-
-**Reason:** You use Gson by accident to access internal fields of Android classes
-
-**Solution:** Write custom Gson [`TypeAdapter`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html) implementations for the affected classes or change the type of your data
-
-**Explanation:**
-
-When no built-in adapter for a type exists and no custom adapter has been registered, Gson falls back to using reflection to access the fields of a class (including `private` ones). Most likely you are experiencing this issue because you (by accident) rely on the reflection-based adapter for Android classes. That should be avoided because you make yourself dependent on the implementation details of these classes which could change at any point.
-
-If you want to prevent using reflection on third-party classes in the future you can write your own [`ReflectionAccessFilter`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/ReflectionAccessFilter.html) or use one of the predefined ones, such as `ReflectionAccessFilter.BLOCK_ALL_PLATFORM`.
-
-## <a id="json-static-fields"></a> JSON output contains values of `static` fields
-
-**Symptom:** The JSON output contains values of `static` fields
-
-**Reason:** You used `GsonBuilder.excludeFieldsWithModifiers` to overwrite the default excluded modifiers
-
-**Solution:** When calling `GsonBuilder.excludeFieldsWithModifiers` you overwrite the default excluded modifiers. Therefore, you have to explicitly exclude `static` fields if desired. This can be done by adding `Modifier.STATIC` as additional argument.
-
-## <a id="no-such-method-error"></a> `NoSuchMethodError` when calling Gson methods
-
-**Symptom:** A `java.lang.NoSuchMethodError` is thrown when trying to call certain Gson methods
-
-**Reason:**
-
-- You have multiple versions of Gson on your classpath
-- Or, the Gson version you compiled against is different from the one on your classpath
-- Or, you are using a code shrinking tool such as ProGuard or R8 which removed methods from Gson
-
-**Solution:** First disable any code shrinking tools such as ProGuard or R8 and check if the issue persists. If not, you have to tweak the configuration of that tool to not modify Gson classes. Otherwise verify that the Gson JAR on your classpath is the same you are compiling against, and that there is only one Gson JAR on your classpath. See [this Stack Overflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/q/227486) to find out where a class is loaded from. For example, for debugging you could include the following code:
-
-```java
-System.out.println(Gson.class.getProtectionDomain().getCodeSource().getLocation());
-```
-
-If that fails with a `NullPointerException` you have to try one of the other ways to find out where a class is loaded from.
-
-## <a id="duplicate-fields"></a> `IllegalArgumentException`: 'Class ... declares multiple JSON fields named '...''
-
-**Symptom:** An exception with the message 'Class ... declares multiple JSON fields named '...'' is thrown
-
-**Reason:**
-
-- The name you have specified with a [`@SerializedName`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/annotations/SerializedName.html) annotation for a field collides with the name of another field
-- The [`FieldNamingStrategy`](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/FieldNamingStrategy.html) you have specified produces conflicting field names
-- A field of your class has the same name as the field of a superclass
-
-Gson prevents multiple fields with the same name because during deserialization it would be ambiguous for which field the JSON data should be deserialized. For serialization it would cause the same field to appear multiple times in JSON. While the JSON specification permits this, it is likely that the application parsing the JSON data will not handle it correctly.
-
-**Solution:** First identify the fields with conflicting names based on the exception message. Then decide if you want to rename one of them using the [`@SerializedName`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/annotations/SerializedName.html) annotation, or if you want to [exclude](UserGuide.md#excluding-fields-from-serialization-and-deserialization) one of them. When excluding one of the fields you have to include it for both serialization and deserialization (even if your application only performs one of these actions) because the duplicate field check cannot differentiate between these actions.
-
-## <a id="java-lang-class-unsupported"></a> `UnsupportedOperationException` when serializing or deserializing `java.lang.Class`
-
-**Symptom:** An `UnsupportedOperationException` is thrown when trying to serialize or deserialize `java.lang.Class`
-
-**Reason:** Gson intentionally does not permit serializing and deserializing `java.lang.Class` for security reasons. Otherwise a malicious user could make your application load an arbitrary class from the classpath and, depending on what your application does with the `Class`, in the worst case perform a remote code execution attack.
-
-**Solution:** First check if you really need to serialize or deserialize a `Class`. Often it is possible to use string aliases and then map them to the known `Class`; you could write a custom [`TypeAdapter`](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html) to do this. If the `Class` values are not known in advance, try to introduce a common base class or interface for all these classes and then verify that the deserialized class is a subclass. For example assuming the base class is called `MyBaseClass`, your custom `TypeAdapter` should load the class like this:
-
-```java
-Class.forName(jsonString, false, getClass().getClassLoader()).asSubclass(MyBaseClass.class)
-```
-
-This will not initialize arbitrary classes, and it will throw a `ClassCastException` if the loaded class is not the same as or a subclass of `MyBaseClass`.
-
-## <a id="type-token-raw"></a> `IllegalStateException`: 'TypeToken must be created with a type argument' <br> `RuntimeException`: 'Missing type parameter'
-
-**Symptom:** An `IllegalStateException` with the message 'TypeToken must be created with a type argument' is thrown.  
-For older Gson versions a `RuntimeException` with message 'Missing type parameter' is thrown.
-
-**Reason:**
-
-- You created a `TypeToken` without type argument, for example `new TypeToken() {}` (note the missing `<...>`). You always have to provide the type argument, for example like this: `new TypeToken<List<String>>() {}`. Normally the compiler will also emit a 'raw types' warning when you forget the `<...>`.
-- You are using a code shrinking tool such as ProGuard or R8 (Android app builds normally have this enabled by default) but have not configured it correctly for usage with Gson.
-
-**Solution:** When you are using a code shrinking tool such as ProGuard or R8 you have to adjust your configuration to include the following rules:
-
-```
-# Keep generic signatures; needed for correct type resolution
--keepattributes Signature
-
-# Keep class TypeToken (respectively its generic signature)
--keep class com.google.gson.reflect.TypeToken { *; }
-
-# Keep any (anonymous) classes extending TypeToken
--keep class * extends com.google.gson.reflect.TypeToken
-```
-
-See also the [Android example](examples/android-proguard-example/README.md) for more information.
-
-Note: For newer Gson versions these rules might be applied automatically; make sure you are using the latest Gson version and the latest version of the code shrinking tool.
-
-## <a id="r8-abstract-class"></a> `JsonIOException`: 'Abstract classes can't be instantiated!' (R8)
-
-**Symptom:** A `JsonIOException` with the message 'Abstract classes can't be instantiated!' is thrown; the class mentioned in the exception message is not actually `abstract` in your source code, and you are using the code shrinking tool R8 (Android app builds normally have this configured by default).
-
-**Reason:** The code shrinking tool R8 performs optimizations where it removes the no-args constructor from a class and makes the class `abstract`. Due to this Gson cannot create an instance of the class.
-
-**Solution:** Make sure the class has a no-args constructor, then adjust your R8 configuration file to keep the constructor of the class. For example:
-
-```
-# Keep the no-args constructor of the deserialized class
--keepclassmembers class com.example.MyClass {
-  <init>();
-}
-```
-
-For Android you can add this rule to the `proguard-rules.pro` file, see also the [Android documentation](https://developer.android.com/build/shrink-code#keep-code). In case the class name in the exception message is obfuscated, see the Android documentation about [retracing](https://developer.android.com/build/shrink-code#retracing).
-
-Note: If the class which you are trying to deserialize is actually abstract, then this exception is probably unrelated to R8 and you will have to implement a custom [`InstanceCreator`](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/InstanceCreator.html) or [`TypeAdapter`](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html) which creates an instance of a non-abstract subclass of the class.

+
+## <a id="class-cast-exception"></a> `ClassCastException` when using deserialized object
+
+**Symptom:** `ClassCastException` is thrown when accessing an object deserialized by Gson
+
+**Reason:** Your code is most likely not type-safe
+
+**Solution:** Make sure your code adheres to the following:
+
+- Avoid raw types: Instead of calling `fromJson(..., List.class)`, create for example a `TypeToken<List<MyClass>>`.
+  See the [user guide](UserGuide.md#collections-examples) for more information.
+- When using `TypeToken` prefer the `Gson.fromJson` overloads with `TypeToken` parameter such as [`fromJson(Reader, TypeToken)`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/Gson.html#fromJson(java.io.Reader,com.google.gson.reflect.TypeToken)).
+  The overloads with `Type` parameter do not provide any type-safety guarantees.
+- When using `TypeToken` make sure you don't capture a type variable. For example avoid something like `new TypeToken<List<T>>()` (where `T` is a type variable). Due to Java type erasure the actual type of `T` is not available at runtime. Refactor your code to pass around `TypeToken` instances or use [`TypeToken.getParameterized(...)`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/reflect/TypeToken.html#getParameterized(java.lang.reflect.Type,java.lang.reflect.Type...)), for example `TypeToken.getParameterized(List.class, elementClass)`.
+
+## <a id="reflection-inaccessible"></a> `InaccessibleObjectException`: 'module ... does not "opens ..." to unnamed module'
+
+**Symptom:** An exception with a message in the form 'module ... does not "opens ..." to unnamed module' is thrown
+
+**Reason:** You use Gson by accident to access internal fields of third-party classes
+
+**Solution:** Write custom Gson [`TypeAdapter`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html) implementations for the affected classes or change the type of your data. If this occurs for a field in one of your classes which you did not actually want to serialize or deserialize in the first place, you can exclude that field, see the [user guide](UserGuide.md#excluding-fields-from-serialization-and-deserialization).
+
+**Explanation:**
+
+When no built-in adapter for a type exists and no custom adapter has been registered, Gson falls back to using reflection to access the fields of a class (including `private` ones). Most likely you are seeing this error because you (by accident) rely on the reflection-based adapter for third-party classes. That should be avoided because you make yourself dependent on the implementation details of these classes which could change at any point. For the JDK it is also not possible anymore to access internal fields using reflection starting with JDK 17, see [JEP 403](https://openjdk.org/jeps/403).
+
+If you want to prevent using reflection on third-party classes in the future you can write your own [`ReflectionAccessFilter`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/ReflectionAccessFilter.html) or use one of the predefined ones, such as `ReflectionAccessFilter.BLOCK_ALL_PLATFORM`.
+
+## <a id="reflection-inaccessible-to-module-gson"></a> `InaccessibleObjectException`: 'module ... does not "opens ..." to module com.google.gson'
+
+**Symptom:** An exception with a message in the form 'module ... does not "opens ..." to module com.google.gson' is thrown
+
+**Reason:**
+
+- If the reported package is your own package then you have not configured the module declaration of your project to allow Gson to use reflection on your classes.
+- If the reported package is from a third party library or the JDK see [this troubleshooting point](#inaccessibleobjectexception-module--does-not-opens--to-unnamed-module).
+
+**Solution:** Make sure the `module-info.java` file of your project allows Gson to use reflection on your classes, for example:
+
+```java
+module mymodule {
+    requires com.google.gson;
+
+    opens mypackage to com.google.gson;
+}
+```
+
+Or in case this occurs for a field in one of your classes which you did not actually want to serialize or deserialize in the first place, you can exclude that field, see the [user guide](UserGuide.md#excluding-fields-from-serialization-and-deserialization).
+
+## <a id="android-app-random-names"></a> Android app not working in Release mode; random property names
+
+**Symptom:** Your Android app is working fine in Debug mode but fails in Release mode and the JSON properties have seemingly random names such as `a`, `b`, ...
+
+**Reason:** You probably have not configured ProGuard / R8 correctly
+
+**Solution:** Make sure you have configured ProGuard / R8 correctly to preserve the names of your fields. See the [Android example](examples/android-proguard-example/README.md) for more information.
+
+## <a id="android-app-broken-after-app-update"></a> Android app unable to parse JSON after app update
+
+**Symptom:** You released a new version of your Android app and it fails to parse JSON data created by the previous version of your app
+
+**Reason:** You probably have not configured ProGuard / R8 correctly; probably the fields names are being obfuscated and their naming changed between the versions of your app
+
+**Solution:** Make sure you have configured ProGuard / R8 correctly to preserve the names of your fields. See the [Android example](examples/android-proguard-example/README.md) for more information.
+
+If you want to preserve backward compatibility for you app you can use [`@SerializedName`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/annotations/SerializedName.html) on the fields to specify the obfuscated name as alternate, for example: `@SerializedName(value = "myprop", alternate = "a")`
+
+Normally ProGuard and R8 produce a mapping file, this makes it easier to find out the obfuscated field names instead of having to find them out through trial and error or other means. See the [Android Studio user guide](https://developer.android.com/studio/build/shrink-code.html#retracing) for more information.
+
+## <a id="default-field-values-missing"></a> Default field values not present after deserialization
+
+**Symptom:** You have assign default values to fields but after deserialization the fields have their standard value (such as `null` or `0`)
+
+**Reason:** Gson cannot invoke the constructor of your class and falls back to JDK `Unsafe` (or similar means)
+
+**Solution:** Make sure that the class:
+
+- is `static` (explicitly or implicitly when it is a top-level class)
+- has a no-args constructor
+
+Otherwise Gson will by default try to use JDK `Unsafe` or similar means to create an instance of your class without invoking the constructor and without running any initializers. You can also disable that behavior through [`GsonBuilder.disableJdkUnsafe()`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.html#disableJdkUnsafe()) to notice such issues early on.
+
+## <a id="anonymous-local-null"></a> `null` values for anonymous and local classes
+
+**Symptom:** Objects of a class are always serialized as JSON `null` / always deserialized as Java `null`
+
+**Reason:** The class you are serializing or deserializing is an anonymous or a local class (or you have specified a custom `ExclusionStrategy`)
+
+**Solution:** Convert the class to a `static` nested class. If the class is already `static` make sure you have not specified a Gson `ExclusionStrategy` which might exclude the class.
+
+Notes:
+
+- "double brace-initialization" also creates anonymous classes
+- Local record classes (feature added in Java 16) are supported by Gson and are not affected by this
+
+## <a id="map-key-wrong-json"></a> Map keys having unexpected format in JSON
+
+**Symptom:** JSON output for `Map` keys is unexpected / cannot be deserialized again
+
+**Reason:** The `Map` key type is 'complex' and you have not configured the `GsonBuilder` properly
+
+**Solution:** Use [`GsonBuilder.enableComplexMapKeySerialization()`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.html#enableComplexMapKeySerialization()). See also the [user guide](UserGuide.md#maps-examples) for more information.
+
+## <a id="malformed-json"></a> Parsing JSON fails with `MalformedJsonException`
+
+**Symptom:** JSON parsing fails with `MalformedJsonException`
+
+**Reason:** The JSON data is actually malformed
+
+**Solution:** During debugging, log the JSON data right before calling Gson methods or set a breakpoint to inspect the data and make sure it has the expected format. Sometimes APIs might return HTML error pages (instead of JSON data) when reaching rate limits or when other errors occur. Also read the location information of the `MalformedJsonException` exception message, it indicates where exactly in the document the malformed data was detected, including the [JSONPath](https://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/).
+
+For example, let's assume you want to deserialize the following JSON data:
+
+```json
+{
+  "languages": [
+    "English",
+    "French",
+  ]
+}
+```
+
+This will fail with an exception similar to this one: `MalformedJsonException: Use JsonReader.setLenient(true) to accept malformed JSON at line 5 column 4 path $.languages[2]`  
+The problem here is the trailing comma (`,`) after `"French"`, trailing commas are not allowed by the JSON specification. The location information "line 5 column 4" points to the `]` in the JSON data (with some slight inaccuracies) because Gson expected another value after `,` instead of the closing `]`. The JSONPath `$.languages[2]` in the exception message also points there: `$.` refers to the root object, `languages` refers to its member of that name and `[2]` refers to the (missing) third value in the JSON array value of that member (numbering starts at 0, so it is `[2]` instead of `[3]`).  
+The proper solution here is to fix the malformed JSON data.
+
+To spot syntax errors in the JSON data easily you can open it in an editor with support for JSON, for example Visual Studio Code. It will highlight within the JSON data the error location and show why the JSON data is considered invalid.
+
+## <a id="number-parsed-as-double"></a> Integral JSON number is parsed as `double`
+
+**Symptom:** JSON data contains an integral number such as `45` but Gson returns it as `double`
+
+**Reason:** When parsing a JSON number as `Object`, Gson will by default create always return a `double`
+
+**Solution:** Use [`GsonBuilder.setObjectToNumberStrategy`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.html#setObjectToNumberStrategy(com.google.gson.ToNumberStrategy)) to specify what type of number should be returned
+
+## <a id="default-lenient"></a> Malformed JSON not rejected
+
+**Symptom:** Gson parses malformed JSON without throwing any exceptions
+
+**Reason:** Due to legacy reasons Gson performs parsing by default in lenient mode
+
+**Solution:** See [`Gson` class documentation](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/Gson.html#default-lenient) section "Lenient JSON handling"
+
+Note: Even in non-lenient mode Gson deviates slightly from the JSON specification, see [`JsonReader.setLenient`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/stream/JsonReader.html#setLenient(boolean)) for more details.
+
+## <a id="unexpected-json-structure"></a> `IllegalStateException`: "Expected ... but was ..."
+
+**Symptom:** An `IllegalStateException` with a message in the form "Expected ... but was ..." is thrown
+
+**Reason:** The JSON data does not have the correct format
+
+**Solution:** Make sure that your classes correctly model the JSON data. Also during debugging log the JSON data right before calling Gson methods or set a breakpoint to inspect the data and make sure it has the expected format. Read the location information of the exception message, it indicates where exactly in the document the error occurred, including the [JSONPath](https://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/).
+
+For example, let's assume you have the following Java class:
+
+```java
+class WebPage {
+    String languages;
+}
+```
+
+And you want to deserialize the following JSON data:
+
+```json
+{
+  "languages": ["English", "French"]
+}
+```
+
+This will fail with an exception similar to this one: `IllegalStateException: Expected a string but was BEGIN_ARRAY at line 2 column 17 path $.languages`  
+This means Gson expected a JSON string value but found the beginning of a JSON array (`[`). The location information "line 2 column 17" points to the `[` in the JSON data (with some slight inaccuracies), so does the JSONPath `$.languages` in the exception message. It refers to the `languages` member of the root object (`$.`).  
+The solution here is to change in the `WebPage` class the field `String languages` to `List<String> languages`.
+
+## <a id="adapter-not-null-safe"></a> `IllegalStateException`: "Expected ... but was NULL"
+
+**Symptom:** An `IllegalStateException` with a message in the form "Expected ... but was NULL" is thrown
+
+**Reason:**
+
+- A built-in adapter does not support JSON null values
+- You have written a custom `TypeAdapter` which does not properly handle JSON null values
+
+**Solution:** If this occurs for a custom adapter you wrote, add code similar to the following at the beginning of its `read` method:
+
+```java
+@Override
+public MyClass read(JsonReader in) throws IOException {
+    if (in.peek() == JsonToken.NULL) {
+        in.nextNull();
+        return null;
+    }
+
+    ...
+}
+```
+
+Alternatively you can call [`nullSafe()`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html#nullSafe()) on the adapter instance you created.
+
+## <a id="serialize-nulls"></a> Properties missing in JSON
+
+**Symptom:** Properties are missing in the JSON output
+
+**Reason:** Gson by default omits JSON null from the output (or: ProGuard / R8 is not configured correctly and removed unused fields)
+
+**Solution:** Use [`GsonBuilder.serializeNulls()`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.html#serializeNulls())
+
+Note: Gson does not support anonymous and local classes and will serialize them as JSON null, see the [related troubleshooting point](#null-values-for-anonymous-and-local-classes).
+
+## <a id="android-internal-fields"></a> JSON output changes for newer Android versions
+
+**Symptom:** The JSON output differs when running on newer Android versions
+
+**Reason:** You use Gson by accident to access internal fields of Android classes
+
+**Solution:** Write custom Gson [`TypeAdapter`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html) implementations for the affected classes or change the type of your data
+
+**Explanation:**
+
+When no built-in adapter for a type exists and no custom adapter has been registered, Gson falls back to using reflection to access the fields of a class (including `private` ones). Most likely you are experiencing this issue because you (by accident) rely on the reflection-based adapter for Android classes.

+
+## <a id="json-static-fields"></a> JSON output contains values of `static` fields
+
+**Symptom:** The JSON output contains values of `static` fields
+
+**Reason:** You used `GsonBuilder.excludeFieldsWithModifiers` to overwrite the default excluded modifiers
+
+**Solution:** When calling `GsonBuilder.excludeFieldsWithModifiers` you overwrite the default excluded modifiers. Therefore, you have to explicitly exclude `static` fields if desired. This can be done by adding `Modifier.STATIC` as additional argument.
+
+## <a id="no-such-method-error"></a> `NoSuchMethodError` when calling Gson methods
+
+**Symptom:** A `java.lang.NoSuchMethodError` is thrown when trying to call certain Gson methods
+
+**Reason:**
+
+- You have multiple versions of Gson on your classpath
+- Or, the Gson version you compiled against is different from the one on your classpath
+- Or, you are using a code shrinking tool such as ProGuard or R8 which removed methods from Gson
+
+**Solution:** First disable any code shrinking tools such as ProGuard or R8 and check if the issue persists. If not, you have to tweak the configuration of that tool to not modify Gson classes. Otherwise verify that the Gson JAR on your classpath is the same you are compiling against, and that there is only one Gson JAR on your classpath. See [this Stack Overflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/q/227486) to find out where a class is loaded from. For example, for debugging you could include the following code:
+
+```java
+System.out.println(Gson.class.getProtectionDomain().getCodeSource().getLocation());
+```
+
+If that fails with a `NullPointerException` you have to try one of the other ways to find out where a class is loaded from.
+
+## <a id="duplicate-fields"></a> `IllegalArgumentException`: 'Class ... declares multiple JSON fields named '...''
+
+**Symptom:** An exception with the message 'Class ... declares multiple JSON fields named '...'' is thrown
+
+**Reason:**
+
+- The name you have specified with a [`@SerializedName`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/annotations/SerializedName.html) annotation for a field collides with the name of another field
+- The [`FieldNamingStrategy`](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/FieldNamingStrategy.html) you have specified produces conflicting field names
+- A field of your class has the same name as the field of a superclass
+
+Gson prevents multiple fields with the same name because during deserialization it would be ambiguous for which field the JSON data should be deserialized. For serialization it would cause the same field to appear multiple times in JSON. While the JSON specification permits this, it is likely that the application parsing the JSON data will not handle it correctly.
+
+**Solution:** First identify the fields with conflicting names based on the exception message. Then decide if you want to rename one of them using the [`@SerializedName`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/annotations/SerializedName.html) annotation, or if you want to [exclude](UserGuide.md#excluding-fields-from-serialization-and-deserialization) one of them. When excluding one of the fields you have to include it for both serialization and deserialization (even if your application only performs one of these actions) because the duplicate field check cannot differentiate between these actions.
+
+## <a id="java-lang-class-unsupported"></a> `UnsupportedOperationException` when serializing or deserializing `java.lang.Class`
+
+**Symptom:** An `UnsupportedOperationException` is thrown when trying to serialize or deserialize `java.lang.Class`
+
+**Reason:** Gson intentionally does not permit serializing and deserializing `java.lang.Class` for security reasons. Otherwise a malicious user could make your application load an arbitrary class from the classpath and, depending on what your application does with the `Class`, in the worst case perform a remote code execution attack.

+**Solution:** First check if you really need to serialize or deserialize a `Class`. Often it is possible to use string aliases and then map them to the known `Class`; you could write a custom [`TypeAdapter`](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html) to do this. If the `Class` values are not known in advance, try to introduce a common base class or interface for all these classes and then verify that the deserialized class is a subclass. For example assuming the base class is called `MyBaseClass`, your custom `TypeAdapter` should load the class like this:
+
+```java
+Class.forName(jsonString, false, getClass().getClassLoader()).asSubclass(MyBaseClass.class)
+```
+
+This will not initialize arbitrary classes, and it will throw a `ClassCastException` if the loaded class is not the same as or a subclass of `MyBaseClass`.
+
+## <a id="type-token-raw"></a> `IllegalStateException`: 'TypeToken must be created with a type argument' <br> `RuntimeException`: 'Missing type parameter'
+
+**Symptom:** An `IllegalStateException` with the message 'TypeToken must be created with a type argument' is thrown.  
+For older Gson versions a `RuntimeException` with message 'Missing type parameter' is thrown.
+
+**Reason:**
+
+- You created a `TypeToken` without type argument, for example `new TypeToken() {}` (note the missing `<...>`). You always have to provide the type argument, for example like this: `new TypeToken<List<String>>() {}`. Normally the compiler will also emit a 'raw types' warning when you forget the `<...>`.
+- You are using a code shrinking tool such as ProGuard or R8 (Android app builds normally have this enabled by default) but have not configured it correctly for usage with Gson.
+
+**Solution:** When you are using a code shrinking tool such as ProGuard or R8 you have to adjust your configuration to include the following rules:
+
+```
+# Keep generic signatures; needed for correct type resolution
+-keepattributes Signature
+
+# Keep class TypeToken (respectively its generic signature)
+-keep class com.google.gson.reflect.TypeToken { *; }
+
+# Keep any (anonymous) classes extending TypeToken
+-keep class * extends com.google.gson.reflect.TypeToken
+```
+
+See also the [Android example](examples/android-proguard-example/README.md) for more information.
+
+Note: For newer Gson versions these rules might be applied automatically; make sure you are using the latest Gson version and the latest version of the code shrinking tool.
+
+## <a id="r8-abstract-class"></a> `JsonIOException`: 'Abstract classes can't be instantiated!' (R8)
+
+**Symptom:** A `JsonIOException` with the message 'Abstract classes can't be instantiated!' is thrown; the class mentioned in the exception message is not actually `abstract` in your source code, and you are using the code shrinking tool R8 (Android app builds normally have this configured by default).
+
+**Reason:** R8 can remove constructors and, in some optimizations, make classes `abstract`. This prevents Gson from creating instances. In some builds, R8 may retain synthetic or additional constructors even after making a class abstract, but instantiation will still fail.
+
+**Solution:** Prefer keeping all constructors of the affected class so R8 neither removes constructors nor changes abstractness when the rule applies. For example:
+
+```
+# Keep all constructors of the deserialized class and keep the class when the rule matches
+-keepclasseswithmembers class com.example.MyClass {
+  <init>(...);
+}
+```
+
+Notes and alternatives:
+
+- Kotlin classes commonly do not have a no-args constructor (for example `class MyClass(val s: String)`). Keeping all constructors avoids mismatches with rules that only keep `<init>()`. If you rely on constructor logic (initializers, default values), consider providing a no-args or secondary constructor that fits your deserialization needs.
+- If no suitable constructor is available, Gson may fall back to JDK Unsafe to create instances without invoking constructors. To detect this early, use [`GsonBuilder.disableJdkUnsafe()`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.html#disableJdkUnsafe()).
+- `-keepclasseswithmembers` keeps the class when the member pattern matches and retains the specified members. Compared to `-keepclassmembers`, it also prevents R8 from changing the class abstractness when the rule applies. If you want to unconditionally keep a class (and all its members), you can use `-keep class com.example.MyClass`.
+- As an Android-friendly alternative, annotate your model class or its constructor with `@Keep` to prevent removal by the shrinker. See the [Android documentation](https://developer.android.com/studio/write/annotations#keep).
+- Newer Gson versions ship default ProGuard/R8 rules that help retain constructors when Gson annotations are present on a class (see `gson/META-INF/proguard/gson.pro` in the JAR). If your class does not use Gson annotations, you may still need an explicit rule or `@Keep`.
+
+For Android you can add these rules to the `proguard-rules.pro` file, see also the [Android documentation](https://developer.android.com/build/shrink-code#keep-code). In case the class name in the exception message is obfuscated, see the Android documentation about [retracing](https://developer.android.com/build/shrink-code#retracing).
+
+Note: If the class which you are trying to deserialize is actually abstract, then this exception is unrelated to R8 and you will have to implement a custom [`InstanceCreator`](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/InstanceCreator.html) or [`TypeAdapter`](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html) which creates an instance of a non-abstract subclass of the class.

 Note that newer Gson versions apply some of the rules shown in `proguard.cfg` automatically by default,
 see the file [`gson/META-INF/proguard/gson.pro`](/gson/src/main/resources/META-INF/proguard/gson.pro) for
 the Gson version you are using.
+
+Additional guidance:
+
+- For classes that are deserialized by Gson, prefer keeping all constructors to avoid R8 removing them or making the class abstract. For example:
+
+```
+-keepclasseswithmembers class com.example.MyClass {
+  <init>(...);
+}
+```
+
+- If your model classes use Gson annotations (such as `@SerializedName`, `@Expose`, `@JsonAdapter`, `@Since`, `@Until`), newer Gson versions ship default rules that conditionally keep constructors when these annotations are present. This reduces the need for manual rules.
+- Kotlin classes often do not have a no-args constructor. Keeping all constructors avoids issues with rules that only keep `<init>()`. If you rely on constructor logic or default property values, consider adding a suitable constructor for deserialization.
+- As an alternative to shrinker rules, annotate classes or constructors with Android's `@Keep` to prevent removal by ProGuard/R8. See the [Android documentation](https://developer.android.com/studio/write/annotations#keep).
+- Ensure generic signatures are preserved when using `TypeToken`, and retain runtime-visible annotations where they influence Gson behavior. The shipped `gson.pro` covers common cases, but project-specific rules may still be required.

-# Troubleshooting Guide
-
-This guide describes how to troubleshoot common issues when using Gson.
-
-<!-- The '<a id="..."></a>' anchors below are used to create stable links; don't remove or rename them -->
-<!-- Use only lowercase IDs, GitHub seems to not support uppercase IDs, see also https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/50962 -->
-
-## <a id="class-cast-exception"></a> `ClassCastException` when using deserialized object
-
-**Symptom:** `ClassCastException` is thrown when accessing an object deserialized by Gson
-
-**Reason:** Your code is most likely not type-safe
-
-**Solution:** Make sure your code adheres to the following:
-
-- Avoid raw types: Instead of calling `fromJson(..., List.class)`, create for example a `TypeToken<List<MyClass>>`.
-  See the [user guide](UserGuide.md#collections-examples) for more information.
-- When using `TypeToken` prefer the `Gson.fromJson` overloads with `TypeToken` parameter such as [`fromJson(Reader, TypeToken)`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/Gson.html#fromJson(java.io.Reader,com.google.gson.reflect.TypeToken)).
-  The overloads with `Type` parameter do not provide any type-safety guarantees.
-- When using `TypeToken` make sure you don't capture a type variable. For example avoid something like `new TypeToken<List<T>>()` (where `T` is a type variable). Due to Java type erasure the actual type of `T` is not available at runtime. Refactor your code to pass around `TypeToken` instances or use [`TypeToken.getParameterized(...)`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/reflect/TypeToken.html#getParameterized(java.lang.reflect.Type,java.lang.reflect.Type...)), for example `TypeToken.getParameterized(List.class, elementClass)`.
-
-## <a id="reflection-inaccessible"></a> `InaccessibleObjectException`: 'module ... does not "opens ..." to unnamed module'
-
-**Symptom:** An exception with a message in the form 'module ... does not "opens ..." to unnamed module' is thrown
-
-**Reason:** You use Gson by accident to access internal fields of third-party classes
-
-**Solution:** Write custom Gson [`TypeAdapter`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html) implementations for the affected classes or change the type of your data. If this occurs for a field in one of your classes which you did not actually want to serialize or deserialize in the first place, you can exclude that field, see the [user guide](UserGuide.md#excluding-fields-from-serialization-and-deserialization).
-
-**Explanation:**
-
-When no built-in adapter for a type exists and no custom adapter has been registered, Gson falls back to using reflection to access the fields of a class (including `private` ones). Most likely you are seeing this error because you (by accident) rely on the reflection-based adapter for third-party classes. That should be avoided because you make yourself dependent on the implementation details of these classes which could change at any point. For the JDK it is also not possible anymore to access internal fields using reflection starting with JDK 17, see [JEP 403](https://openjdk.org/jeps/403).
-
-If you want to prevent using reflection on third-party classes in the future you can write your own [`ReflectionAccessFilter`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/ReflectionAccessFilter.html) or use one of the predefined ones, such as `ReflectionAccessFilter.BLOCK_ALL_PLATFORM`.
-
-## <a id="reflection-inaccessible-to-module-gson"></a> `InaccessibleObjectException`: 'module ... does not "opens ..." to module com.google.gson'
-
-**Symptom:** An exception with a message in the form 'module ... does not "opens ..." to module com.google.gson' is thrown
-
-**Reason:**
-
-- If the reported package is your own package then you have not configured the module declaration of your project to allow Gson to use reflection on your classes.
-- If the reported package is from a third party library or the JDK see [this troubleshooting point](#inaccessibleobjectexception-module--does-not-opens--to-unnamed-module).
-
-**Solution:** Make sure the `module-info.java` file of your project allows Gson to use reflection on your classes, for example:
-
-```java
-module mymodule {
-    requires com.google.gson;
-
-    opens mypackage to com.google.gson;
-}
-```
-
-Or in case this occurs for a field in one of your classes which you did not actually want to serialize or deserialize in the first place, you can exclude that field, see the [user guide](UserGuide.md#excluding-fields-from-serialization-and-deserialization).
-
-## <a id="android-app-random-names"></a> Android app not working in Release mode; random property names
-
-**Symptom:** Your Android app is working fine in Debug mode but fails in Release mode and the JSON properties have seemingly random names such as `a`, `b`, ...
-
-**Reason:** You probably have not configured ProGuard / R8 correctly
-
-**Solution:** Make sure you have configured ProGuard / R8 correctly to preserve the names of your fields. See the [Android example](examples/android-proguard-example/README.md) for more information.
-
-## <a id="android-app-broken-after-app-update"></a> Android app unable to parse JSON after app update
-
-**Symptom:** You released a new version of your Android app and it fails to parse JSON data created by the previous version of your app
-
-**Reason:** You probably have not configured ProGuard / R8 correctly; probably the fields names are being obfuscated and their naming changed between the versions of your app
-
-**Solution:** Make sure you have configured ProGuard / R8 correctly to preserve the names of your fields. See the [Android example](examples/android-proguard-example/README.md) for more information.
-
-If you want to preserve backward compatibility for you app you can use [`@SerializedName`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/annotations/SerializedName.html) on the fields to specify the obfuscated name as alternate, for example: `@SerializedName(value = "myprop", alternate = "a")`
-
-Normally ProGuard and R8 produce a mapping file, this makes it easier to find out the obfuscated field names instead of having to find them out through trial and error or other means. See the [Android Studio user guide](https://developer.android.com/studio/build/shrink-code.html#retracing) for more information.
-
-## <a id="default-field-values-missing"></a> Default field values not present after deserialization
-
-**Symptom:** You have assign default values to fields but after deserialization the fields have their standard value (such as `null` or `0`)
-
-**Reason:** Gson cannot invoke the constructor of your class and falls back to JDK `Unsafe` (or similar means)
-
-**Solution:** Make sure that the class:
-
-- is `static` (explicitly or implicitly when it is a top-level class)
-- has a no-args constructor
-
-Otherwise Gson will by default try to use JDK `Unsafe` or similar means to create an instance of your class without invoking the constructor and without running any initializers. You can also disable that behavior through [`GsonBuilder.disableJdkUnsafe()`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.html#disableJdkUnsafe()) to notice such issues early on.
-
-## <a id="anonymous-local-null"></a> `null` values for anonymous and local classes
-
-**Symptom:** Objects of a class are always serialized as JSON `null` / always deserialized as Java `null`
-
-**Reason:** The class you are serializing or deserializing is an anonymous or a local class (or you have specified a custom `ExclusionStrategy`)
-
-**Solution:** Convert the class to a `static` nested class. If the class is already `static` make sure you have not specified a Gson `ExclusionStrategy` which might exclude the class.
-
-Notes:
-
-- "double brace-initialization" also creates anonymous classes
-- Local record classes (feature added in Java 16) are supported by Gson and are not affected by this
-
-## <a id="map-key-wrong-json"></a> Map keys having unexpected format in JSON
-
-**Symptom:** JSON output for `Map` keys is unexpected / cannot be deserialized again
-
-**Reason:** The `Map` key type is 'complex' and you have not configured the `GsonBuilder` properly
-
-**Solution:** Use [`GsonBuilder.enableComplexMapKeySerialization()`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.html#enableComplexMapKeySerialization()). See also the [user guide](UserGuide.md#maps-examples) for more information.
-
-## <a id="malformed-json"></a> Parsing JSON fails with `MalformedJsonException`
-
-**Symptom:** JSON parsing fails with `MalformedJsonException`
-
-**Reason:** The JSON data is actually malformed
-
-**Solution:** During debugging, log the JSON data right before calling Gson methods or set a breakpoint to inspect the data and make sure it has the expected format. Sometimes APIs might return HTML error pages (instead of JSON data) when reaching rate limits or when other errors occur. Also read the location information of the `MalformedJsonException` exception message, it indicates where exactly in the document the malformed data was detected, including the [JSONPath](https://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/).
-
-For example, let's assume you want to deserialize the following JSON data:
-
-```json
-{
-  "languages": [
-    "English",
-    "French",
-  ]
-}
-```
-
-This will fail with an exception similar to this one: `MalformedJsonException: Use JsonReader.setLenient(true) to accept malformed JSON at line 5 column 4 path $.languages[2]`  
-The problem here is the trailing comma (`,`) after `"French"`, trailing commas are not allowed by the JSON specification. The location information "line 5 column 4" points to the `]` in the JSON data (with some slight inaccuracies) because Gson expected another value after `,` instead of the closing `]`. The JSONPath `$.languages[2]` in the exception message also points there: `$.` refers to the root object, `languages` refers to its member of that name and `[2]` refers to the (missing) third value in the JSON array value of that member (numbering starts at 0, so it is `[2]` instead of `[3]`).  
-The proper solution here is to fix the malformed JSON data.
-
-To spot syntax errors in the JSON data easily you can open it in an editor with support for JSON, for example Visual Studio Code. It will highlight within the JSON data the error location and show why the JSON data is considered invalid.
-
-## <a id="number-parsed-as-double"></a> Integral JSON number is parsed as `double`
-
-**Symptom:** JSON data contains an integral number such as `45` but Gson returns it as `double`
-
-**Reason:** When parsing a JSON number as `Object`, Gson will by default create always return a `double`
-
-**Solution:** Use [`GsonBuilder.setObjectToNumberStrategy`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.html#setObjectToNumberStrategy(com.google.gson.ToNumberStrategy)) to specify what type of number should be returned
-
-## <a id="default-lenient"></a> Malformed JSON not rejected
-
-**Symptom:** Gson parses malformed JSON without throwing any exceptions
-
-**Reason:** Due to legacy reasons Gson performs parsing by default in lenient mode
-
-**Solution:** See [`Gson` class documentation](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/Gson.html#default-lenient) section "Lenient JSON handling"
-
-Note: Even in non-lenient mode Gson deviates slightly from the JSON specification, see [`JsonReader.setLenient`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/stream/JsonReader.html#setLenient(boolean)) for more details.
-
-## <a id="unexpected-json-structure"></a> `IllegalStateException`: "Expected ... but was ..."
-
-**Symptom:** An `IllegalStateException` with a message in the form "Expected ... but was ..." is thrown
-
-**Reason:** The JSON data does not have the correct format
-
-**Solution:** Make sure that your classes correctly model the JSON data. Also during debugging log the JSON data right before calling Gson methods or set a breakpoint to inspect the data and make sure it has the expected format. Read the location information of the exception message, it indicates where exactly in the document the error occurred, including the [JSONPath](https://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/).
-
-For example, let's assume you have the following Java class:
-
-```java
-class WebPage {
-    String languages;
-}
-```
-
-And you want to deserialize the following JSON data:
-
-```json
-{
-  "languages": ["English", "French"]
-}
-```
-
-This will fail with an exception similar to this one: `IllegalStateException: Expected a string but was BEGIN_ARRAY at line 2 column 17 path $.languages`  
-This means Gson expected a JSON string value but found the beginning of a JSON array (`[`). The location information "line 2 column 17" points to the `[` in the JSON data (with some slight inaccuracies), so does the JSONPath `$.languages` in the exception message. It refers to the `languages` member of the root object (`$.`).  
-The solution here is to change in the `WebPage` class the field `String languages` to `List<String> languages`.
-
-## <a id="adapter-not-null-safe"></a> `IllegalStateException`: "Expected ... but was NULL"
-
-**Symptom:** An `IllegalStateException` with a message in the form "Expected ... but was NULL" is thrown
-
-**Reason:**
-
-- A built-in adapter does not support JSON null values
-- You have written a custom `TypeAdapter` which does not properly handle JSON null values
-
-**Solution:** If this occurs for a custom adapter you wrote, add code similar to the following at the beginning of its `read` method:
-
-```java
-@Override
-public MyClass read(JsonReader in) throws IOException {
-    if (in.peek() == JsonToken.NULL) {
-        in.nextNull();
-        return null;
-    }
-
-    ...
-}
-```
-
-Alternatively you can call [`nullSafe()`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html#nullSafe()) on the adapter instance you created.
-
-## <a id="serialize-nulls"></a> Properties missing in JSON
-
-**Symptom:** Properties are missing in the JSON output
-
-**Reason:** Gson by default omits JSON null from the output (or: ProGuard / R8 is not configured correctly and removed unused fields)
-
-**Solution:** Use [`GsonBuilder.serializeNulls()`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.html#serializeNulls())
-
-Note: Gson does not support anonymous and local classes and will serialize them as JSON null, see the [related troubleshooting point](#null-values-for-anonymous-and-local-classes).
-
-## <a id="android-internal-fields"></a> JSON output changes for newer Android versions
-
-**Symptom:** The JSON output differs when running on newer Android versions
-
-**Reason:** You use Gson by accident to access internal fields of Android classes
-
-**Solution:** Write custom Gson [`TypeAdapter`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html) implementations for the affected classes or change the type of your data
-
-**Explanation:**
-
-When no built-in adapter for a type exists and no custom adapter has been registered, Gson falls back to using reflection to access the fields of a class (including `private` ones). Most likely you are experiencing this issue because you (by accident) rely on the reflection-based adapter for Android classes. That should be avoided because you make yourself dependent on the implementation details of these classes which could change at any point.
-
-If you want to prevent using reflection on third-party classes in the future you can write your own [`ReflectionAccessFilter`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/ReflectionAccessFilter.html) or use one of the predefined ones, such as `ReflectionAccessFilter.BLOCK_ALL_PLATFORM`.
-
-## <a id="json-static-fields"></a> JSON output contains values of `static` fields
-
-**Symptom:** The JSON output contains values of `static` fields
-
-**Reason:** You used `GsonBuilder.excludeFieldsWithModifiers` to overwrite the default excluded modifiers
-
-**Solution:** When calling `GsonBuilder.excludeFieldsWithModifiers` you overwrite the default excluded modifiers. Therefore, you have to explicitly exclude `static` fields if desired. This can be done by adding `Modifier.STATIC` as additional argument.
-
-## <a id="no-such-method-error"></a> `NoSuchMethodError` when calling Gson methods
-
-**Symptom:** A `java.lang.NoSuchMethodError` is thrown when trying to call certain Gson methods
-
-**Reason:**
-
-- You have multiple versions of Gson on your classpath
-- Or, the Gson version you compiled against is different from the one on your classpath
-- Or, you are using a code shrinking tool such as ProGuard or R8 which removed methods from Gson
-
-**Solution:** First disable any code shrinking tools such as ProGuard or R8 and check if the issue persists. If not, you have to tweak the configuration of that tool to not modify Gson classes. Otherwise verify that the Gson JAR on your classpath is the same you are compiling against, and that there is only one Gson JAR on your classpath. See [this Stack Overflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/q/227486) to find out where a class is loaded from. For example, for debugging you could include the following code:
-
-```java
-System.out.println(Gson.class.getProtectionDomain().getCodeSource().getLocation());
-```
-
-If that fails with a `NullPointerException` you have to try one of the other ways to find out where a class is loaded from.
-
-## <a id="duplicate-fields"></a> `IllegalArgumentException`: 'Class ... declares multiple JSON fields named '...''
-
-**Symptom:** An exception with the message 'Class ... declares multiple JSON fields named '...'' is thrown
-
-**Reason:**
-
-- The name you have specified with a [`@SerializedName`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/annotations/SerializedName.html) annotation for a field collides with the name of another field
-- The [`FieldNamingStrategy`](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/FieldNamingStrategy.html) you have specified produces conflicting field names
-- A field of your class has the same name as the field of a superclass
-
-Gson prevents multiple fields with the same name because during deserialization it would be ambiguous for which field the JSON data should be deserialized. For serialization it would cause the same field to appear multiple times in JSON. While the JSON specification permits this, it is likely that the application parsing the JSON data will not handle it correctly.
-
-**Solution:** First identify the fields with conflicting names based on the exception message. Then decide if you want to rename one of them using the [`@SerializedName`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/annotations/SerializedName.html) annotation, or if you want to [exclude](UserGuide.md#excluding-fields-from-serialization-and-deserialization) one of them. When excluding one of the fields you have to include it for both serialization and deserialization (even if your application only performs one of these actions) because the duplicate field check cannot differentiate between these actions.
-
-## <a id="java-lang-class-unsupported"></a> `UnsupportedOperationException` when serializing or deserializing `java.lang.Class`
-
-**Symptom:** An `UnsupportedOperationException` is thrown when trying to serialize or deserialize `java.lang.Class`
-
-**Reason:** Gson intentionally does not permit serializing and deserializing `java.lang.Class` for security reasons. Otherwise a malicious user could make your application load an arbitrary class from the classpath and, depending on what your application does with the `Class`, in the worst case perform a remote code execution attack.
-
-**Solution:** First check if you really need to serialize or deserialize a `Class`. Often it is possible to use string aliases and then map them to the known `Class`; you could write a custom [`TypeAdapter`](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html) to do this. If the `Class` values are not known in advance, try to introduce a common base class or interface for all these classes and then verify that the deserialized class is a subclass. For example assuming the base class is called `MyBaseClass`, your custom `TypeAdapter` should load the class like this:
-
-```java
-Class.forName(jsonString, false, getClass().getClassLoader()).asSubclass(MyBaseClass.class)
-```
-
-This will not initialize arbitrary classes, and it will throw a `ClassCastException` if the loaded class is not the same as or a subclass of `MyBaseClass`.
-
-## <a id="type-token-raw"></a> `IllegalStateException`: 'TypeToken must be created with a type argument' <br> `RuntimeException`: 'Missing type parameter'
-
-**Symptom:** An `IllegalStateException` with the message 'TypeToken must be created with a type argument' is thrown.  
-For older Gson versions a `RuntimeException` with message 'Missing type parameter' is thrown.
-
-**Reason:**
-
-- You created a `TypeToken` without type argument, for example `new TypeToken() {}` (note the missing `<...>`). You always have to provide the type argument, for example like this: `new TypeToken<List<String>>() {}`. Normally the compiler will also emit a 'raw types' warning when you forget the `<...>`.
-- You are using a code shrinking tool such as ProGuard or R8 (Android app builds normally have this enabled by default) but have not configured it correctly for usage with Gson.
-
-**Solution:** When you are using a code shrinking tool such as ProGuard or R8 you have to adjust your configuration to include the following rules:
-
-```
-# Keep generic signatures; needed for correct type resolution
--keepattributes Signature
-
-# Keep class TypeToken (respectively its generic signature)
--keep class com.google.gson.reflect.TypeToken { *; }
-
-# Keep any (anonymous) classes extending TypeToken
--keep class * extends com.google.gson.reflect.TypeToken
-```
-
-See also the [Android example](examples/android-proguard-example/README.md) for more information.
-
-Note: For newer Gson versions these rules might be applied automatically; make sure you are using the latest Gson version and the latest version of the code shrinking tool.
-
-## <a id="r8-abstract-class"></a> `JsonIOException`: 'Abstract classes can't be instantiated!' (R8)
-
-**Symptom:** A `JsonIOException` with the message 'Abstract classes can't be instantiated!' is thrown; the class mentioned in the exception message is not actually `abstract` in your source code, and you are using the code shrinking tool R8 (Android app builds normally have this configured by default).
-
-**Reason:** The code shrinking tool R8 performs optimizations where it removes the no-args constructor from a class and makes the class `abstract`. Due to this Gson cannot create an instance of the class.
-
-**Solution:** Make sure the class has a no-args constructor, then adjust your R8 configuration file to keep the constructor of the class. For example:
-
-```
-# Keep the no-args constructor of the deserialized class
--keepclassmembers class com.example.MyClass {
-  <init>();
-}
-```
-
-For Android you can add this rule to the `proguard-rules.pro` file, see also the [Android documentation](https://developer.android.com/build/shrink-code#keep-code). In case the class name in the exception message is obfuscated, see the Android documentation about [retracing](https://developer.android.com/build/shrink-code#retracing).
-
-Note: If the class which you are trying to deserialize is actually abstract, then this exception is probably unrelated to R8 and you will have to implement a custom [`InstanceCreator`](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/InstanceCreator.html) or [`TypeAdapter`](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html) which creates an instance of a non-abstract subclass of the class.

+
+## <a id="class-cast-exception"></a> `ClassCastException` when using deserialized object
+
+**Symptom:** `ClassCastException` is thrown when accessing an object deserialized by Gson
+
+**Reason:** Your code is most likely not type-safe
+
+**Solution:** Make sure your code adheres to the following:
+
+- Avoid raw types: Instead of calling `fromJson(..., List.class)`, create for example a `TypeToken<List<MyClass>>`.
+  See the [user guide](UserGuide.md#collections-examples) for more information.
+- When using `TypeToken` prefer the `Gson.fromJson` overloads with `TypeToken` parameter such as [`fromJson(Reader, TypeToken)`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/Gson.html#fromJson(java.io.Reader,com.google.gson.reflect.TypeToken)).
+  The overloads with `Type` parameter do not provide any type-safety guarantees.
+- When using `TypeToken` make sure you don't capture a type variable. For example avoid something like `new TypeToken<List<T>>()` (where `T` is a type variable). Due to Java type erasure the actual type of `T` is not available at runtime. Refactor your code to pass around `TypeToken` instances or use [`TypeToken.getParameterized(...)`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/reflect/TypeToken.html#getParameterized(java.lang.reflect.Type,java.lang.reflect.Type...)), for example `TypeToken.getParameterized(List.class, elementClass)`.
+
+## <a id="reflection-inaccessible"></a> `InaccessibleObjectException`: 'module ... does not "opens ..." to unnamed module'
+
+**Symptom:** An exception with a message in the form 'module ... does not "opens ..." to unnamed module' is thrown
+
+**Reason:** You use Gson by accident to access internal fields of third-party classes
+
+**Solution:** Write custom Gson [`TypeAdapter`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html) implementations for the affected classes or change the type of your data. If this occurs for a field in one of your classes which you did not actually want to serialize or deserialize in the first place, you can exclude that field, see the [user guide](UserGuide.md#excluding-fields-from-serialization-and-deserialization).
+
+**Explanation:**
+
+When no built-in adapter for a type exists and no custom adapter has been registered, Gson falls back to using reflection to access the fields of a class (including `private` ones). Most likely you are seeing this error because you (by accident) rely on the reflection-based adapter for third-party classes. That should be avoided because you make yourself dependent on the implementation details of these classes which could change at any point. For the JDK it is also not possible anymore to access internal fields using reflection starting with JDK 17, see [JEP 403](https://openjdk.org/jeps/403).
+
+If you want to prevent using reflection on third-party classes in the future you can write your own [`ReflectionAccessFilter`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/ReflectionAccessFilter.html) or use one of the predefined ones, such as `ReflectionAccessFilter.BLOCK_ALL_PLATFORM`.
+
+## <a id="reflection-inaccessible-to-module-gson"></a> `InaccessibleObjectException`: 'module ... does not "opens ..." to module com.google.gson'
+
+**Symptom:** An exception with a message in the form 'module ... does not "opens ..." to module com.google.gson' is thrown
+
+**Reason:**
+
+- If the reported package is your own package then you have not configured the module declaration of your project to allow Gson to use reflection on your classes.
+- If the reported package is from a third party library or the JDK see [this troubleshooting point](#inaccessibleobjectexception-module--does-not-opens--to-unnamed-module).
+
+**Solution:** Make sure the `module-info.java` file of your project allows Gson to use reflection on your classes, for example:
+
+```java
+module mymodule {
+    requires com.google.gson;
+
+    opens mypackage to com.google.gson;
+}
+```
+
+Or in case this occurs for a field in one of your classes which you did not actually want to serialize or deserialize in the first place, you can exclude that field, see the [user guide](UserGuide.md#excluding-fields-from-serialization-and-deserialization).
+
+## <a id="android-app-random-names"></a> Android app not working in Release mode; random property names
+
+**Symptom:** Your Android app is working fine in Debug mode but fails in Release mode and the JSON properties have seemingly random names such as `a`, `b`, ...
+
+**Reason:** You probably have not configured ProGuard / R8 correctly
+
+**Solution:** Make sure you have configured ProGuard / R8 correctly to preserve the names of your fields. See the [Android example](examples/android-proguard-example/README.md) for more information.
+
+## <a id="android-app-broken-after-app-update"></a> Android app unable to parse JSON after app update
+
+**Symptom:** You released a new version of your Android app and it fails to parse JSON data created by the previous version of your app
+
+**Reason:** You probably have not configured ProGuard / R8 correctly; probably the fields names are being obfuscated and their naming changed between the versions of your app
+
+**Solution:** Make sure you have configured ProGuard / R8 correctly to preserve the names of your fields. See the [Android example](examples/android-proguard-example/README.md) for more information.
+
+If you want to preserve backward compatibility for you app you can use [`@SerializedName`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/annotations/SerializedName.html) on the fields to specify the obfuscated name as alternate, for example: `@SerializedName(value = "myprop", alternate = "a")`
+
+Normally ProGuard and R8 produce a mapping file, this makes it easier to find out the obfuscated field names instead of having to find them out through trial and error or other means. See the [Android Studio user guide](https://developer.android.com/studio/build/shrink-code.html#retracing) for more information.
+
+## <a id="default-field-values-missing"></a> Default field values not present after deserialization
+
+**Symptom:** You have assign default values to fields but after deserialization the fields have their standard value (such as `null` or `0`)
+
+**Reason:** Gson cannot invoke the constructor of your class and falls back to JDK `Unsafe` (or similar means)
+
+**Solution:** Make sure that the class:
+
+- is `static` (explicitly or implicitly when it is a top-level class)
+- has a no-args constructor
+
+Otherwise Gson will by default try to use JDK `Unsafe` or similar means to create an instance of your class without invoking the constructor and without running any initializers. You can also disable that behavior through [`GsonBuilder.disableJdkUnsafe()`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.html#disableJdkUnsafe()) to notice such issues early on.
+
+## <a id="anonymous-local-null"></a> `null` values for anonymous and local classes
+
+**Symptom:** Objects of a class are always serialized as JSON `null` / always deserialized as Java `null`
+
+**Reason:** The class you are serializing or deserializing is an anonymous or a local class (or you have specified a custom `ExclusionStrategy`)
+
+**Solution:** Convert the class to a `static` nested class. If the class is already `static` make sure you have not specified a Gson `ExclusionStrategy` which might exclude the class.
+
+Notes:
+
+- "double brace-initialization" also creates anonymous classes
+- Local record classes (feature added in Java 16) are supported by Gson and are not affected by this
+
+## <a id="map-key-wrong-json"></a> Map keys having unexpected format in JSON
+
+**Symptom:** JSON output for `Map` keys is unexpected / cannot be deserialized again
+
+**Reason:** The `Map` key type is 'complex' and you have not configured the `GsonBuilder` properly
+
+**Solution:** Use [`GsonBuilder.enableComplexMapKeySerialization()`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.html#enableComplexMapKeySerialization()). See also the [user guide](UserGuide.md#maps-examples) for more information.
+
+## <a id="malformed-json"></a> Parsing JSON fails with `MalformedJsonException`
+
+**Symptom:** JSON parsing fails with `MalformedJsonException`
+
+**Reason:** The JSON data is actually malformed
+
+**Solution:** During debugging, log the JSON data right before calling Gson methods or set a breakpoint to inspect the data and make sure it has the expected format. Sometimes APIs might return HTML error pages (instead of JSON data) when reaching rate limits or when other errors occur. Also read the location information of the `MalformedJsonException` exception message, it indicates where exactly in the document the malformed data was detected, including the [JSONPath](https://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/).
+
+For example, let's assume you want to deserialize the following JSON data:
+
+```json
+{
+  "languages": [
+    "English",
+    "French",
+  ]
+}
+```
+
+This will fail with an exception similar to this one: `MalformedJsonException: Use JsonReader.setLenient(true) to accept malformed JSON at line 5 column 4 path $.languages[2]`  
+The problem here is the trailing comma (`,`) after `"French"`, trailing commas are not allowed by the JSON specification. The location information "line 5 column 4" points to the `]` in the JSON data (with some slight inaccuracies) because Gson expected another value after `,` instead of the closing `]`. The JSONPath `$.languages[2]` in the exception message also points there: `$.` refers to the root object, `languages` refers to its member of that name and `[2]` refers to the (missing) third value in the JSON array value of that member (numbering starts at 0, so it is `[2]` instead of `[3]`).  
+The proper solution here is to fix the malformed JSON data.
+
+To spot syntax errors in the JSON data easily you can open it in an editor with support for JSON, for example Visual Studio Code. It will highlight within the JSON data the error location and show why the JSON data is considered invalid.
+
+## <a id="number-parsed-as-double"></a> Integral JSON number is parsed as `double`
+
+**Symptom:** JSON data contains an integral number such as `45` but Gson returns it as `double`
+
+**Reason:** When parsing a JSON number as `Object`, Gson will by default create always return a `double`
+
+**Solution:** Use [`GsonBuilder.setObjectToNumberStrategy`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.html#setObjectToNumberStrategy(com.google.gson.ToNumberStrategy)) to specify what type of number should be returned
+
+## <a id="default-lenient"></a> Malformed JSON not rejected
+
+**Symptom:** Gson parses malformed JSON without throwing any exceptions
+
+**Reason:** Due to legacy reasons Gson performs parsing by default in lenient mode
+
+**Solution:** See [`Gson` class documentation](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/Gson.html#default-lenient) section "Lenient JSON handling"
+
+Note: Even in non-lenient mode Gson deviates slightly from the JSON specification, see [`JsonReader.setLenient`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/stream/JsonReader.html#setLenient(boolean)) for more details.
+
+## <a id="unexpected-json-structure"></a> `IllegalStateException`: "Expected ... but was ..."
+
+**Symptom:** An `IllegalStateException` with a message in the form "Expected ... but was ..." is thrown
+
+**Reason:** The JSON data does not have the correct format
+
+**Solution:** Make sure that your classes correctly model the JSON data. Also during debugging log the JSON data right before calling Gson methods or set a breakpoint to inspect the data and make sure it has the expected format. Read the location information of the exception message, it indicates where exactly in the document the error occurred, including the [JSONPath](https://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/).
+
+For example, let's assume you have the following Java class:
+
+```java
+class WebPage {
+    String languages;
+}
+```
+
+And you want to deserialize the following JSON data:
+
+```json
+{
+  "languages": ["English", "French"]
+}
+```
+
+This will fail with an exception similar to this one: `IllegalStateException: Expected a string but was BEGIN_ARRAY at line 2 column 17 path $.languages`  
+This means Gson expected a JSON string value but found the beginning of a JSON array (`[`). The location information "line 2 column 17" points to the `[` in the JSON data (with some slight inaccuracies), so does the JSONPath `$.languages` in the exception message. It refers to the `languages` member of the root object (`$.`).  
+The solution here is to change in the `WebPage` class the field `String languages` to `List<String> languages`.
+
+## <a id="adapter-not-null-safe"></a> `IllegalStateException`: "Expected ... but was NULL"
+
+**Symptom:** An `IllegalStateException` with a message in the form "Expected ... but was NULL" is thrown
+
+**Reason:**
+
+- A built-in adapter does not support JSON null values
+- You have written a custom `TypeAdapter` which does not properly handle JSON null values
+
+**Solution:** If this occurs for a custom adapter you wrote, add code similar to the following at the beginning of its `read` method:
+
+```java
+@Override
+public MyClass read(JsonReader in) throws IOException {
+    if (in.peek() == JsonToken.NULL) {
+        in.nextNull();
+        return null;
+    }
+
+    ...
+}
+```
+
+Alternatively you can call [`nullSafe()`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html#nullSafe()) on the adapter instance you created.
+
+## <a id="serialize-nulls"></a> Properties missing in JSON
+
+**Symptom:** Properties are missing in the JSON output
+
+**Reason:** Gson by default omits JSON null from the output (or: ProGuard / R8 is not configured correctly and removed unused fields)
+
+**Solution:** Use [`GsonBuilder.serializeNulls()`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.html#serializeNulls())
+
+Note: Gson does not support anonymous and local classes and will serialize them as JSON null, see the [related troubleshooting point](#null-values-for-anonymous-and-local-classes).
+
+## <a id="android-internal-fields"></a> JSON output changes for newer Android versions
+
+**Symptom:** The JSON output differs when running on newer Android versions
+
+**Reason:** You use Gson by accident to access internal fields of Android classes
+
+**Solution:** Write custom Gson [`TypeAdapter`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html) implementations for the affected classes or change the type of your data
+
+**Explanation:**
+
+When no built-in adapter for a type exists and no custom adapter has been registered, Gson falls back to using reflection to access the fields of a class (including `private` ones). Most likely you are experiencing this issue because you (by accident) rely on the reflection-based adapter for Android classes. That should be avoided because you make yourself dependent on the implementation details of these classes which could change at any point.
+
+If you want to prevent using reflection on third-party classes in the future you can write your own [`ReflectionAccessFilter`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/ReflectionAccessFilter.html) or use one of the predefined ones, such as `ReflectionAccessFilter.BLOCK_ALL_PLATFORM`.
+
+## <a id="json-static-fields"></a> JSON output contains values of `static` fields
+
+**Symptom:** The JSON output contains values of `static` fields
+
+**Reason:** You used `GsonBuilder.excludeFieldsWithModifiers` to overwrite the default excluded modifiers
+
+**Solution:** When calling `GsonBuilder.excludeFieldsWithModifiers` you overwrite the default excluded modifiers. Therefore, you have to explicitly exclude `static` fields if desired. This can be done by adding `Modifier.STATIC` as additional argument.
+
+## <a id="no-such-method-error"></a> `NoSuchMethodError` when calling Gson methods
+
+**Symptom:** A `java.lang.NoSuchMethodError` is thrown when trying to call certain Gson methods
+
+**Reason:**
+
+- You have multiple versions of Gson on your classpath
+- Or, the Gson version you compiled against is different from the one on your classpath
+- Or, you are using a code shrinking tool such as ProGuard or R8 which removed methods from Gson
+
+**Solution:** First disable any code shrinking tools such as ProGuard or R8 and check if the issue persists. If not, you have to tweak the configuration of that tool to not modify Gson classes. Otherwise verify that the Gson JAR on your classpath is the same you are compiling against, and that there is only one Gson JAR on your classpath. See [this Stack Overflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/q/227486) to find out where a class is loaded from. For example, for debugging you could include the following code:
+
+```java
+System.out.println(Gson.class.getProtectionDomain().getCodeSource().getLocation());
+```
+
+If that fails with a `NullPointerException` you have to try one of the other ways to find out where a class is loaded from.
+
+## <a id="duplicate-fields"></a> `IllegalArgumentException`: 'Class ... declares multiple JSON fields named '...''
+
+**Symptom:** An exception with the message 'Class ... declares multiple JSON fields named '...'' is thrown
+
+**Reason:**
+
+- The name you have specified with a [`@SerializedName`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/annotations/SerializedName.html) annotation for a field collides with the name of another field
+- The [`FieldNamingStrategy`](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/FieldNamingStrategy.html) you have specified produces conflicting field names
+- A field of your class has the same name as the field of a superclass
+
+Gson prevents multiple fields with the same name because during deserialization it would be ambiguous for which field the JSON data should be deserialized. For serialization it would cause the same field to appear multiple times in JSON. While the JSON specification permits this, it is likely that the application parsing the JSON data will not handle it correctly.
+
+**Solution:** First identify the fields with conflicting names based on the exception message. Then decide if you want to rename one of them using the [`@SerializedName`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/annotations/SerializedName.html) annotation, or if you want to [exclude](UserGuide.md#excluding-fields-from-serialization-and-deserialization) one of them. When excluding one of the fields you have to include it for both serialization and deserialization (even if your application only performs one of these actions) because the duplicate field check cannot differentiate between these actions.
+
+## <a id="java-lang-class-unsupported"></a> `UnsupportedOperationException` when serializing or deserializing `java.lang.Class`
+
+**Symptom:** An `UnsupportedOperationException` is thrown when trying to serialize or deserialize `java.lang.Class`
+
+**Reason:** Gson intentionally does not permit serializing and deserializing `java.lang.Class` for security reasons. Otherwise a malicious user could make your application load an arbitrary class from the classpath and, depending on what your application does with the `Class`, in the worst case perform a remote code execution attack.
+
+**Solution:** First check if you really need to serialize or deserialize a `Class`. Often it is possible to use string aliases and then map them to the known `Class`; you could write a custom [`TypeAdapter`](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html) to do this. If the `Class` values are not known in advance, try to introduce a common base class or interface for all these classes and then verify that the deserialized class is a subclass. For example assuming the base class is called `MyBaseClass`, your custom `TypeAdapter` should load the class like this:
+
+```java
+Class.forName(jsonString, false, getClass().getClassLoader()).asSubclass(MyBaseClass.class)
+```
+
+This will not initialize arbitrary classes, and it will throw a `ClassCastException` if the loaded class is not the same as or a subclass of `MyBaseClass`.
+
+## <a id="type-token-raw"></a> `IllegalStateException`: 'TypeToken must be created with a type argument' <br> `RuntimeException`: 'Missing type parameter'
+
+**Symptom:** An `IllegalStateException` with the message 'TypeToken must be created with a type argument' is thrown.  
+For older Gson versions a `RuntimeException` with message 'Missing type parameter' is thrown.
+
+**Reason:**
+
+- You created a `TypeToken` without type argument, for example `new TypeToken() {}` (note the missing `<...>`). You always have to provide the type argument, for example like this: `new TypeToken<List<String>>() {}`. Normally the compiler will also emit a 'raw types' warning when you forget the `<...>`.
+- You are using a code shrinking tool such as ProGuard or R8 (Android app builds normally have this enabled by default) but have not configured it correctly for usage with Gson.
+
+**Solution:** When you are using a code shrinking tool such as ProGuard or R8 you have to adjust your configuration to include the following rules:
+
+```
+# Keep generic signatures; needed for correct type resolution
+-keepattributes Signature
+
+# Keep class TypeToken (respectively its generic signature)
+-keep class com.google.gson.reflect.TypeToken { *; }
+
+# Keep any (anonymous) classes extending TypeToken
+-keep class * extends com.google.gson.reflect.TypeToken
+```
+
+See also the [Android example](examples/android-proguard-example/README.md) for more information.
+
+Note: For newer Gson versions these rules might be applied automatically; make sure you are using the latest Gson version and the latest version of the code shrinking tool.
+
+## <a id="r8-abstract-class"></a> `JsonIOException`: 'Abstract classes can't be instantiated!' (R8)
+
+**Symptom:** A `JsonIOException` with the message 'Abstract classes can't be instantiated!' is thrown; the class mentioned in the exception message is not actually `abstract` in your source code, and you are using the code shrinking tool R8 (Android app builds normally have this configured by default).
+
+**Reason:** The code shrinking tool R8 performs optimizations where it may remove constructors and make a class `abstract`. Due to this Gson cannot create an instance of the class.
+
+**Solution:** Prefer keeping all constructors of the class to avoid issues where a no-args constructor does not exist (common for Kotlin classes with only a primary constructor).
+
+Example keeping all constructors of a specific class:
+
+```
+# Keep all constructors of the deserialized class
+-keep class com.example.MyClass {
+  <init>(...);
+}
+```
+
+Notes on -keep vs -keepclassmembers:
+
+- `-keep` is more robust in scenarios where a specific constructor signature does not exist; it also helps prevent R8 from turning the class into `abstract`.
+- `-keepclassmembers` only keeps the specified members; if you use `<init>();` but the class has no no-args constructor, the rule does not match and R8 optimizations may still make the class abstract.
+
+Annotation-based rules (general approach):
+
+You can configure ProGuard/R8 to keep constructors for classes that are likely used with Gson by detecting Gson annotations on fields or types. This reduces the chance that classes are turned `abstract` or have their constructors removed. For example:
+
+```
+# If a class has fields annotated with @SerializedName, keep all its constructors
+-if class * {
+  @com.google.gson.annotations.SerializedName <fields>;
+}
+-keep class <1> {
+  <init>(...);
+}
+# Also keep classes with members matching @SerializedName to avoid abstract-class transformation
+-keepclasseswithmembers class * {
+  @com.google.gson.annotations.SerializedName <fields>;
+}
+
+# Repeat similarly for other Gson annotations:
+-if class * {
+  @com.google.gson.annotations.Expose <fields>;
+}
+-keep class <1> {
+  <init>(...);
+}
+-keepclasseswithmembers class * {
+  @com.google.gson.annotations.Expose <fields>;
+}
+
+-if class * {
+  @com.google.gson.annotations.Since <fields>;
+}
+-keep class <1> {
+  <init>(...);
+}
+-keepclasseswithmembers class * {
+  @com.google.gson.annotations.Since <fields>;
+}
+
+-if class * {
+  @com.google.gson.annotations.Until <fields>;
+}
+-keep class <1> {
+  <init>(...);
+}
+-keepclasseswithmembers class * {
+  @com.google.gson.annotations.Until <fields>;
+}
+
+# For @JsonAdapter on fields
+-if class * {
+  @com.google.gson.annotations.JsonAdapter <fields>;
+}
+-keep class <1> {
+  <init>(...);
+}
+-keepclasseswithmembers class * {
+  @com.google.gson.annotations.JsonAdapter <fields>;
+}
+
+# If a class itself is annotated with @JsonAdapter, keep all its constructors
+-if @com.google.gson.annotations.JsonAdapter class *
+-keep class <1> {
+  <init>(...);
+}
+```
+
+Android-specific tip:
+
+- Instead of ProGuard/R8 configuration, you can annotate the class or constructor with `@Keep` to prevent removal or obfuscation as needed. See https://developer.android.com/studio/write/annotations#keep
+
+Kotlin note:
+
+- Many Kotlin classes do not have a no-args constructor because properties are typically declared via a primary constructor (e.g., `class MyClass(val s: String)`). Gson may use JDK Unsafe by default to instantiate such classes without calling a constructor. If you disable this behavior via `GsonBuilder.disableJdkUnsafe()`, you must provide a suitable constructor or register an `InstanceCreator`/`TypeAdapter`.
+
+If the class is truly abstract in your source code:
+
+- This exception is unrelated to R8. You will have to implement a custom [`InstanceCreator`](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/InstanceCreator.html) or [`TypeAdapter`](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html) that creates an instance of a concrete subtype.

 the Gson version you are using.
+
+Additional tips:
+
+- Newer Gson versions include default rules to keep constructors for classes that are likely used with Gson based on annotations like `@SerializedName`, `@Expose`, `@Since`, `@Until`, and `@JsonAdapter`. This helps prevent R8 from making such classes abstract or removing their constructors.
+- If you prefer not to manage ProGuard/R8 rules per class, consider using Android's `@Keep` annotation on the class or constructor. See https://developer.android.com/studio/write/annotations#keep
+- These defaults do not prevent obfuscation of field names. If you need stable JSON property names across releases, use `@SerializedName` with explicit names or add additional rules to preserve field names as needed.

-# Troubleshooting Guide
-
-This guide describes how to troubleshoot common issues when using Gson.
-
-<!-- The '<a id="..."></a>' anchors below are used to create stable links; don't remove or rename them -->
-<!-- Use only lowercase IDs, GitHub seems to not support uppercase IDs, see also https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/50962 -->
-
-## <a id="class-cast-exception"></a> `ClassCastException` when using deserialized object
-
-**Symptom:** `ClassCastException` is thrown when accessing an object deserialized by Gson
-
-**Reason:** Your code is most likely not type-safe
-
-**Solution:** Make sure your code adheres to the following:
-
-- Avoid raw types: Instead of calling `fromJson(..., List.class)`, create for example a `TypeToken<List<MyClass>>`.
-  See the [user guide](UserGuide.md#collections-examples) for more information.
-- When using `TypeToken` prefer the `Gson.fromJson` overloads with `TypeToken` parameter such as [`fromJson(Reader, TypeToken)`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/Gson.html#fromJson(java.io.Reader,com.google.gson.reflect.TypeToken)).
-  The overloads with `Type` parameter do not provide any type-safety guarantees.
-- When using `TypeToken` make sure you don't capture a type variable. For example avoid something like `new TypeToken<List<T>>()` (where `T` is a type variable). Due to Java type erasure the actual type of `T` is not available at runtime. Refactor your code to pass around `TypeToken` instances or use [`TypeToken.getParameterized(...)`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/reflect/TypeToken.html#getParameterized(java.lang.reflect.Type,java.lang.reflect.Type...)), for example `TypeToken.getParameterized(List.class, elementClass)`.
-
-## <a id="reflection-inaccessible"></a> `InaccessibleObjectException`: 'module ... does not "opens ..." to unnamed module'
-
-**Symptom:** An exception with a message in the form 'module ... does not "opens ..." to unnamed module' is thrown
-
-**Reason:** You use Gson by accident to access internal fields of third-party classes
-
-**Solution:** Write custom Gson [`TypeAdapter`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html) implementations for the affected classes or change the type of your data. If this occurs for a field in one of your classes which you did not actually want to serialize or deserialize in the first place, you can exclude that field, see the [user guide](UserGuide.md#excluding-fields-from-serialization-and-deserialization).
-
-**Explanation:**
-
-When no built-in adapter for a type exists and no custom adapter has been registered, Gson falls back to using reflection to access the fields of a class (including `private` ones). Most likely you are seeing this error because you (by accident) rely on the reflection-based adapter for third-party classes. That should be avoided because you make yourself dependent on the implementation details of these classes which could change at any point. For the JDK it is also not possible anymore to access internal fields using reflection starting with JDK 17, see [JEP 403](https://openjdk.org/jeps/403).
-
-If you want to prevent using reflection on third-party classes in the future you can write your own [`ReflectionAccessFilter`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/ReflectionAccessFilter.html) or use one of the predefined ones, such as `ReflectionAccessFilter.BLOCK_ALL_PLATFORM`.
-
-## <a id="reflection-inaccessible-to-module-gson"></a> `InaccessibleObjectException`: 'module ... does not "opens ..." to module com.google.gson'
-
-**Symptom:** An exception with a message in the form 'module ... does not "opens ..." to module com.google.gson' is thrown
-
-**Reason:**
-
-- If the reported package is your own package then you have not configured the module declaration of your project to allow Gson to use reflection on your classes.
-- If the reported package is from a third party library or the JDK see [this troubleshooting point](#inaccessibleobjectexception-module--does-not-opens--to-unnamed-module).
-
-**Solution:** Make sure the `module-info.java` file of your project allows Gson to use reflection on your classes, for example:
-
-```java
-module mymodule {
-    requires com.google.gson;
-
-    opens mypackage to com.google.gson;
-}
-```
-
-Or in case this occurs for a field in one of your classes which you did not actually want to serialize or deserialize in the first place, you can exclude that field, see the [user guide](UserGuide.md#excluding-fields-from-serialization-and-deserialization).
-
-## <a id="android-app-random-names"></a> Android app not working in Release mode; random property names
-
-**Symptom:** Your Android app is working fine in Debug mode but fails in Release mode and the JSON properties have seemingly random names such as `a`, `b`, ...
-
-**Reason:** You probably have not configured ProGuard / R8 correctly
-
-**Solution:** Make sure you have configured ProGuard / R8 correctly to preserve the names of your fields. See the [Android example](examples/android-proguard-example/README.md) for more information.
-
-## <a id="android-app-broken-after-app-update"></a> Android app unable to parse JSON after app update
-
-**Symptom:** You released a new version of your Android app and it fails to parse JSON data created by the previous version of your app
-
-**Reason:** You probably have not configured ProGuard / R8 correctly; probably the fields names are being obfuscated and their naming changed between the versions of your app
-
-**Solution:** Make sure you have configured ProGuard / R8 correctly to preserve the names of your fields. See the [Android example](examples/android-proguard-example/README.md) for more information.
-
-If you want to preserve backward compatibility for you app you can use [`@SerializedName`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/annotations/SerializedName.html) on the fields to specify the obfuscated name as alternate, for example: `@SerializedName(value = "myprop", alternate = "a")`
-
-Normally ProGuard and R8 produce a mapping file, this makes it easier to find out the obfuscated field names instead of having to find them out through trial and error or other means. See the [Android Studio user guide](https://developer.android.com/studio/build/shrink-code.html#retracing) for more information.
-
-## <a id="default-field-values-missing"></a> Default field values not present after deserialization
-
-**Symptom:** You have assign default values to fields but after deserialization the fields have their standard value (such as `null` or `0`)
-
-**Reason:** Gson cannot invoke the constructor of your class and falls back to JDK `Unsafe` (or similar means)
-
-**Solution:** Make sure that the class:
-
-- is `static` (explicitly or implicitly when it is a top-level class)
-- has a no-args constructor
-
-Otherwise Gson will by default try to use JDK `Unsafe` or similar means to create an instance of your class without invoking the constructor and without running any initializers. You can also disable that behavior through [`GsonBuilder.disableJdkUnsafe()`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.html#disableJdkUnsafe()) to notice such issues early on.
-
-## <a id="anonymous-local-null"></a> `null` values for anonymous and local classes
-
-**Symptom:** Objects of a class are always serialized as JSON `null` / always deserialized as Java `null`
-
-**Reason:** The class you are serializing or deserializing is an anonymous or a local class (or you have specified a custom `ExclusionStrategy`)
-
-**Solution:** Convert the class to a `static` nested class. If the class is already `static` make sure you have not specified a Gson `ExclusionStrategy` which might exclude the class.
-
-Notes:
-
-- "double brace-initialization" also creates anonymous classes
-- Local record classes (feature added in Java 16) are supported by Gson and are not affected by this
-
-## <a id="map-key-wrong-json"></a> Map keys having unexpected format in JSON
-
-**Symptom:** JSON output for `Map` keys is unexpected / cannot be deserialized again
-
-**Reason:** The `Map` key type is 'complex' and you have not configured the `GsonBuilder` properly
-
-**Solution:** Use [`GsonBuilder.enableComplexMapKeySerialization()`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.html#enableComplexMapKeySerialization()). See also the [user guide](UserGuide.md#maps-examples) for more information.
-
-## <a id="malformed-json"></a> Parsing JSON fails with `MalformedJsonException`
-
-**Symptom:** JSON parsing fails with `MalformedJsonException`
-
-**Reason:** The JSON data is actually malformed
-
-**Solution:** During debugging, log the JSON data right before calling Gson methods or set a breakpoint to inspect the data and make sure it has the expected format. Sometimes APIs might return HTML error pages (instead of JSON data) when reaching rate limits or when other errors occur. Also read the location information of the `MalformedJsonException` exception message, it indicates where exactly in the document the malformed data was detected, including the [JSONPath](https://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/).
-
-For example, let's assume you want to deserialize the following JSON data:
-
-```json
-{
-  "languages": [
-    "English",
-    "French",
-  ]
-}
-```
-
-This will fail with an exception similar to this one: `MalformedJsonException: Use JsonReader.setLenient(true) to accept malformed JSON at line 5 column 4 path $.languages[2]`  
-The problem here is the trailing comma (`,`) after `"French"`, trailing commas are not allowed by the JSON specification. The location information "line 5 column 4" points to the `]` in the JSON data (with some slight inaccuracies) because Gson expected another value after `,` instead of the closing `]`. The JSONPath `$.languages[2]` in the exception message also points there: `$.` refers to the root object, `languages` refers to its member of that name and `[2]` refers to the (missing) third value in the JSON array value of that member (numbering starts at 0, so it is `[2]` instead of `[3]`).  
-The proper solution here is to fix the malformed JSON data.
-
-To spot syntax errors in the JSON data easily you can open it in an editor with support for JSON, for example Visual Studio Code. It will highlight within the JSON data the error location and show why the JSON data is considered invalid.
-
-## <a id="number-parsed-as-double"></a> Integral JSON number is parsed as `double`
-
-**Symptom:** JSON data contains an integral number such as `45` but Gson returns it as `double`
-
-**Reason:** When parsing a JSON number as `Object`, Gson will by default create always return a `double`
-
-**Solution:** Use [`GsonBuilder.setObjectToNumberStrategy`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.html#setObjectToNumberStrategy(com.google.gson.ToNumberStrategy)) to specify what type of number should be returned
-
-## <a id="default-lenient"></a> Malformed JSON not rejected
-
-**Symptom:** Gson parses malformed JSON without throwing any exceptions
-
-**Reason:** Due to legacy reasons Gson performs parsing by default in lenient mode
-
-**Solution:** See [`Gson` class documentation](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/Gson.html#default-lenient) section "Lenient JSON handling"
-
-Note: Even in non-lenient mode Gson deviates slightly from the JSON specification, see [`JsonReader.setLenient`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/stream/JsonReader.html#setLenient(boolean)) for more details.
-
-## <a id="unexpected-json-structure"></a> `IllegalStateException`: "Expected ... but was ..."
-
-**Symptom:** An `IllegalStateException` with a message in the form "Expected ... but was ..." is thrown
-
-**Reason:** The JSON data does not have the correct format
-
-**Solution:** Make sure that your classes correctly model the JSON data. Also during debugging log the JSON data right before calling Gson methods or set a breakpoint to inspect the data and make sure it has the expected format. Read the location information of the exception message, it indicates where exactly in the document the error occurred, including the [JSONPath](https://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/).
-
-For example, let's assume you have the following Java class:
-
-```java
-class WebPage {
-    String languages;
-}
-```
-
-And you want to deserialize the following JSON data:
-
-```json
-{
-  "languages": ["English", "French"]
-}
-```
-
-This will fail with an exception similar to this one: `IllegalStateException: Expected a string but was BEGIN_ARRAY at line 2 column 17 path $.languages`  
-This means Gson expected a JSON string value but found the beginning of a JSON array (`[`). The location information "line 2 column 17" points to the `[` in the JSON data (with some slight inaccuracies), so does the JSONPath `$.languages` in the exception message. It refers to the `languages` member of the root object (`$.`).  
-The solution here is to change in the `WebPage` class the field `String languages` to `List<String> languages`.
-
-## <a id="adapter-not-null-safe"></a> `IllegalStateException`: "Expected ... but was NULL"
-
-**Symptom:** An `IllegalStateException` with a message in the form "Expected ... but was NULL" is thrown
-
-**Reason:**
-
-- A built-in adapter does not support JSON null values
-- You have written a custom `TypeAdapter` which does not properly handle JSON null values
-
-**Solution:** If this occurs for a custom adapter you wrote, add code similar to the following at the beginning of its `read` method:
-
-```java
-@Override
-public MyClass read(JsonReader in) throws IOException {
-    if (in.peek() == JsonToken.NULL) {
-        in.nextNull();
-        return null;
-    }
-
-    ...
-}
-```
-
-Alternatively you can call [`nullSafe()`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html#nullSafe()) on the adapter instance you created.
-
-## <a id="serialize-nulls"></a> Properties missing in JSON
-
-**Symptom:** Properties are missing in the JSON output
-
-**Reason:** Gson by default omits JSON null from the output (or: ProGuard / R8 is not configured correctly and removed unused fields)
-
-**Solution:** Use [`GsonBuilder.serializeNulls()`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.html#serializeNulls())
-
-Note: Gson does not support anonymous and local classes and will serialize them as JSON null, see the [related troubleshooting point](#null-values-for-anonymous-and-local-classes).
-
-## <a id="android-internal-fields"></a> JSON output changes for newer Android versions
-
-**Symptom:** The JSON output differs when running on newer Android versions
-
-**Reason:** You use Gson by accident to access internal fields of Android classes
-
-**Solution:** Write custom Gson [`TypeAdapter`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html) implementations for the affected classes or change the type of your data
-
-**Explanation:**
-
-When no built-in adapter for a type exists and no custom adapter has been registered, Gson falls back to using reflection to access the fields of a class (including `private` ones). Most likely you are experiencing this issue because you (by accident) rely on the reflection-based adapter for Android classes. That should be avoided because you make yourself dependent on the implementation details of these classes which could change at any point.
-
-If you want to prevent using reflection on third-party classes in the future you can write your own [`ReflectionAccessFilter`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/ReflectionAccessFilter.html) or use one of the predefined ones, such as `ReflectionAccessFilter.BLOCK_ALL_PLATFORM`.
-
-## <a id="json-static-fields"></a> JSON output contains values of `static` fields
-
-**Symptom:** The JSON output contains values of `static` fields
-
-**Reason:** You used `GsonBuilder.excludeFieldsWithModifiers` to overwrite the default excluded modifiers
-
-**Solution:** When calling `GsonBuilder.excludeFieldsWithModifiers` you overwrite the default excluded modifiers. Therefore, you have to explicitly exclude `static` fields if desired. This can be done by adding `Modifier.STATIC` as additional argument.
-
-## <a id="no-such-method-error"></a> `NoSuchMethodError` when calling Gson methods
-
-**Symptom:** A `java.lang.NoSuchMethodError` is thrown when trying to call certain Gson methods
-
-**Reason:**
-
-- You have multiple versions of Gson on your classpath
-- Or, the Gson version you compiled against is different from the one on your classpath
-- Or, you are using a code shrinking tool such as ProGuard or R8 which removed methods from Gson
-
-**Solution:** First disable any code shrinking tools such as ProGuard or R8 and check if the issue persists. If not, you have to tweak the configuration of that tool to not modify Gson classes. Otherwise verify that the Gson JAR on your classpath is the same you are compiling against, and that there is only one Gson JAR on your classpath. See [this Stack Overflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/q/227486) to find out where a class is loaded from. For example, for debugging you could include the following code:
-
-```java
-System.out.println(Gson.class.getProtectionDomain().getCodeSource().getLocation());
-```
-
-If that fails with a `NullPointerException` you have to try one of the other ways to find out where a class is loaded from.
-
-## <a id="duplicate-fields"></a> `IllegalArgumentException`: 'Class ... declares multiple JSON fields named '...''
-
-**Symptom:** An exception with the message 'Class ... declares multiple JSON fields named '...'' is thrown
-
-**Reason:**
-
-- The name you have specified with a [`@SerializedName`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/annotations/SerializedName.html) annotation for a field collides with the name of another field
-- The [`FieldNamingStrategy`](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/FieldNamingStrategy.html) you have specified produces conflicting field names
-- A field of your class has the same name as the field of a superclass
-
-Gson prevents multiple fields with the same name because during deserialization it would be ambiguous for which field the JSON data should be deserialized. For serialization it would cause the same field to appear multiple times in JSON. While the JSON specification permits this, it is likely that the application parsing the JSON data will not handle it correctly.
-
-**Solution:** First identify the fields with conflicting names based on the exception message. Then decide if you want to rename one of them using the [`@SerializedName`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/annotations/SerializedName.html) annotation, or if you want to [exclude](UserGuide.md#excluding-fields-from-serialization-and-deserialization) one of them. When excluding one of the fields you have to include it for both serialization and deserialization (even if your application only performs one of these actions) because the duplicate field check cannot differentiate between these actions.
-
-## <a id="java-lang-class-unsupported"></a> `UnsupportedOperationException` when serializing or deserializing `java.lang.Class`
-
-**Symptom:** An `UnsupportedOperationException` is thrown when trying to serialize or deserialize `java.lang.Class`
-
-**Reason:** Gson intentionally does not permit serializing and deserializing `java.lang.Class` for security reasons. Otherwise a malicious user could make your application load an arbitrary class from the classpath and, depending on what your application does with the `Class`, in the worst case perform a remote code execution attack.
-
-**Solution:** First check if you really need to serialize or deserialize a `Class`. Often it is possible to use string aliases and then map them to the known `Class`; you could write a custom [`TypeAdapter`](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html) to do this. If the `Class` values are not known in advance, try to introduce a common base class or interface for all these classes and then verify that the deserialized class is a subclass. For example assuming the base class is called `MyBaseClass`, your custom `TypeAdapter` should load the class like this:
-
-```java
-Class.forName(jsonString, false, getClass().getClassLoader()).asSubclass(MyBaseClass.class)
-```
-
-This will not initialize arbitrary classes, and it will throw a `ClassCastException` if the loaded class is not the same as or a subclass of `MyBaseClass`.
-
-## <a id="type-token-raw"></a> `IllegalStateException`: 'TypeToken must be created with a type argument' <br> `RuntimeException`: 'Missing type parameter'
-
-**Symptom:** An `IllegalStateException` with the message 'TypeToken must be created with a type argument' is thrown.  
-For older Gson versions a `RuntimeException` with message 'Missing type parameter' is thrown.
-
-**Reason:**
-
-- You created a `TypeToken` without type argument, for example `new TypeToken() {}` (note the missing `<...>`). You always have to provide the type argument, for example like this: `new TypeToken<List<String>>() {}`. Normally the compiler will also emit a 'raw types' warning when you forget the `<...>`.
-- You are using a code shrinking tool such as ProGuard or R8 (Android app builds normally have this enabled by default) but have not configured it correctly for usage with Gson.
-
-**Solution:** When you are using a code shrinking tool such as ProGuard or R8 you have to adjust your configuration to include the following rules:
-
-```
-# Keep generic signatures; needed for correct type resolution
--keepattributes Signature
-
-# Keep class TypeToken (respectively its generic signature)
--keep class com.google.gson.reflect.TypeToken { *; }
-
-# Keep any (anonymous) classes extending TypeToken
--keep class * extends com.google.gson.reflect.TypeToken
-```
-
-See also the [Android example](examples/android-proguard-example/README.md) for more information.
-
-Note: For newer Gson versions these rules might be applied automatically; make sure you are using the latest Gson version and the latest version of the code shrinking tool.
-
-## <a id="r8-abstract-class"></a> `JsonIOException`: 'Abstract classes can't be instantiated!' (R8)
-
-**Symptom:** A `JsonIOException` with the message 'Abstract classes can't be instantiated!' is thrown; the class mentioned in the exception message is not actually `abstract` in your source code, and you are using the code shrinking tool R8 (Android app builds normally have this configured by default).
-
-**Reason:** The code shrinking tool R8 performs optimizations where it removes the no-args constructor from a class and makes the class `abstract`. Due to this Gson cannot create an instance of the class.
-
-**Solution:** Make sure the class has a no-args constructor, then adjust your R8 configuration file to keep the constructor of the class. For example:
-
-```
-# Keep the no-args constructor of the deserialized class
--keepclassmembers class com.example.MyClass {
-  <init>();
-}
-```
-
-For Android you can add this rule to the `proguard-rules.pro` file, see also the [Android documentation](https://developer.android.com/build/shrink-code#keep-code). In case the class name in the exception message is obfuscated, see the Android documentation about [retracing](https://developer.android.com/build/shrink-code#retracing).
-
-Note: If the class which you are trying to deserialize is actually abstract, then this exception is probably unrelated to R8 and you will have to implement a custom [`InstanceCreator`](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/InstanceCreator.html) or [`TypeAdapter`](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html) which creates an instance of a non-abstract subclass of the class.

+
+## <a id="class-cast-exception"></a> `ClassCastException` when using deserialized object
+
+**Symptom:** `ClassCastException` is thrown when accessing an object deserialized by Gson
+
+**Reason:** Your code is most likely not type-safe
+
+**Solution:** Make sure your code adheres to the following:
+
+- Avoid raw types: Instead of calling `fromJson(..., List.class)`, create for example a `TypeToken<List<MyClass>>`.
+  See the [user guide](UserGuide.md#collections-examples) for more information.
+- When using `TypeToken` prefer the `Gson.fromJson` overloads with `TypeToken` parameter such as [`fromJson(Reader, TypeToken)`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/Gson.html#fromJson(java.io.Reader,com.google.gson.reflect.TypeToken)).
+  The overloads with `Type` parameter do not provide any type-safety guarantees.
+- When using `TypeToken` make sure you don't capture a type variable. For example avoid something like `new TypeToken<List<T>>()` (where `T` is a type variable). Due to Java type erasure the actual type of `T` is not available at runtime. Refactor your code to pass around `TypeToken` instances or use [`TypeToken.getParameterized(...)`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/reflect/TypeToken.html#getParameterized(java.lang.reflect.Type,java.lang.reflect.Type...)), for example `TypeToken.getParameterized(List.class, elementClass)`.
+
+## <a id="reflection-inaccessible"></a> `InaccessibleObjectException`: 'module ... does not "opens ..." to unnamed module'
+
+**Symptom:** An exception with a message in the form 'module ... does not "opens ..." to unnamed module' is thrown
+
+**Reason:** You use Gson by accident to access internal fields of third-party classes
+
+**Solution:** Write custom Gson [`TypeAdapter`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html) implementations for the affected classes or change the type of your data. If this occurs for a field in one of your classes which you did not actually want to serialize or deserialize in the first place, you can exclude that field, see the [user guide](UserGuide.md#excluding-fields-from-serialization-and-deserialization).
+
+**Explanation:**
+
+When no built-in adapter for a type exists and no custom adapter has been registered, Gson falls back to using reflection to access the fields of a class (including `private` ones). Most likely you are seeing this error because you (by accident) rely on the reflection-based adapter for third-party classes. That should be avoided because you make yourself dependent on the implementation details of these classes which could change at any point. For the JDK it is also not possible anymore to access internal fields using reflection starting with JDK 17, see [JEP 403](https://openjdk.org/jeps/403).
+
+If you want to prevent using reflection on third-party classes in the future you can write your own [`ReflectionAccessFilter`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/ReflectionAccessFilter.html) or use one of the predefined ones, such as `ReflectionAccessFilter.BLOCK_ALL_PLATFORM`.
+
+## <a id="reflection-inaccessible-to-module-gson"></a> `InaccessibleObjectException`: 'module ... does not "opens ..." to module com.google.gson'
+
+**Symptom:** An exception with a message in the form 'module ... does not "opens ..." to module com.google.gson' is thrown
+
+**Reason:**
+
+- If the reported package is your own package then you have not configured the module declaration of your project to allow Gson to use reflection on your classes.

+
+## <a id="android-app-random-names"></a> Android app not working in Release mode; random property names
+
+**Symptom:** Your Android app is working fine in Debug mode but fails in Release mode and the JSON properties have seemingly random names such as `a`, `b`, ...
+
+**Reason:** You probably have not configured ProGuard / R8 correctly
+
+**Solution:** Make sure you have configured ProGuard / R8 correctly to preserve the names of your fields. See the [Android example](examples/android-proguard-example/README.md) for more information.
+
+## <a id="android-app-broken-after-app-update"></a> Android app unable to parse JSON after app update
+
+**Symptom:** You released a new version of your Android app and it fails to parse JSON data created by the previous version of your app
+
+**Reason:** You probably have not configured ProGuard / R8 correctly; probably the fields names are being obfuscated and their naming changed between the versions of your app
+
+**Solution:** Make sure you have configured ProGuard / R8 correctly to preserve the names of your fields. See the [Android example](examples/android-proguard-example/README.md) for more information.
+
+If you want to preserve backward compatibility for you app you can use [`@SerializedName`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/annotations/SerializedName.html) on the fields to specify the obfuscated name as alternate, for example: `@SerializedName(value = "myprop", alternate = "a")`
+
+Normally ProGuard and R8 produce a mapping file, this makes it easier to find out the obfuscated field names instead of having to find them out through trial and error or other means. See the [Android Studio user guide](https://developer.android.com/studio/build/shrink-code.html#retracing) for more information.
+
+## <a id="default-field-values-missing"></a> Default field values not present after deserialization
+
+**Symptom:** You have assign default values to fields but after deserialization the fields have their standard value (such as `null` or `0`)
+
+**Reason:** Gson cannot invoke the constructor of your class and falls back to JDK `Unsafe` (or similar means)
+
+**Solution:** Make sure that the class:
+
+- is `static` (explicitly or implicitly when it is a top-level class)
+- has a no-args constructor
+
+Otherwise Gson will by default try to use JDK `Unsafe` or similar means to create an instance of your class without invoking the constructor and without running any initializers. You can also disable that behavior through [`GsonBuilder.disableJdkUnsafe()`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.html#disableJdkUnsafe()) to notice such issues early on.
+
+## <a id="anonymous-local-null"></a> `null` values for anonymous and local classes
+
+**Symptom:** Objects of a class are always serialized as JSON `null` / always deserialized as Java `null`
+
+**Reason:** The class you are serializing or deserializing is an anonymous or a local class (or you have specified a custom `ExclusionStrategy`)
+
+**Solution:** Convert the class to a `static` nested class. If the class is already `static` make sure you have not specified a Gson `ExclusionStrategy` which might exclude the class.
+
+Notes:
+
+- "double brace-initialization" also creates anonymous classes
+- Local record classes (feature added in Java 16) are supported by Gson and are not affected by this
+
+## <a id="map-key-wrong-json"></a> Map keys having unexpected format in JSON
+
+**Symptom:** JSON output for `Map` keys is unexpected / cannot be deserialized again
+
+**Reason:** The `Map` key type is 'complex' and you have not configured the `GsonBuilder` properly
+
+**Solution:** Use [`GsonBuilder.enableComplexMapKeySerialization()`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.html#enableComplexMapKeySerialization()). See also the [user guide](UserGuide.md#maps-examples) for more information.
+
+## <a id="malformed-json"></a> Parsing JSON fails with `MalformedJsonException`
+
+**Symptom:** JSON parsing fails with `MalformedJsonException`
+
+**Reason:** The JSON data is actually malformed
+
+**Solution:** During debugging, log the JSON data right before calling Gson methods or set a breakpoint to inspect the data and make sure it has the expected format. Sometimes APIs might return HTML error pages (instead of JSON data) when reaching rate limits or when other errors occur. Also read the location information of the `MalformedJsonException` exception message, it indicates where exactly in the document the malformed data was detected, including the [JSONPath](https://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/).
+
+For example, let's assume you want to deserialize the following JSON data:
+
+```json
+{
+  "languages": [
+    "English",
+    "French",
+  ]
+}
+```
+
+This will fail with an exception similar to this one: `MalformedJsonException: Use JsonReader.setLenient(true) to accept malformed JSON at line 5 column 4 path $.languages[2]`  
+The problem here is the trailing comma (`,`) after `"French"`, trailing commas are not allowed by the JSON specification. The location information "line 5 column 4" points to the `]` in the JSON data (with some slight inaccuracies) because Gson expected another value after `,` instead of the closing `]`. The JSONPath `$.languages[2]` in the exception message also points there: `$.` refers to the root object, `languages` refers to its member of that name and `[2]` refers to the (missing) third value in the JSON array value of that member (numbering starts at 0, so it is `[2]` instead of `[3]`).  
+The proper solution here is to fix the malformed JSON data.
+
+To spot syntax errors in the JSON data easily you can open it in an editor with support for JSON, for example Visual Studio Code. It will highlight within the JSON data the error location and show why the JSON data is considered invalid.
+
+## <a id="number-parsed-as-double"></a> Integral JSON number is parsed as `double`
+
+**Symptom:** JSON data contains an integral number such as `45` but Gson returns it as `double`
+
+**Reason:** When parsing a JSON number as `Object`, Gson will by default create always return a `double`
+
+**Solution:** Use [`GsonBuilder.setObjectToNumberStrategy`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.html#setObjectToNumberStrategy(com.google.gson.ToNumberStrategy)) to specify what type of number should be returned
+
+## <a id="default-lenient"></a> Malformed JSON not rejected
+
+**Symptom:** Gson parses malformed JSON without throwing any exceptions
+
+**Reason:** Due to legacy reasons Gson performs parsing by default in lenient mode
+
+**Solution:** See [`Gson` class documentation](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/Gson.html#default-lenient) section "Lenient JSON handling"
+
+Note: Even in non-lenient mode Gson deviates slightly from the JSON specification, see [`JsonReader.setLenient`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/stream/JsonReader.html#setLenient(boolean)) for more details.
+
+## <a id="unexpected-json-structure"></a> `IllegalStateException`: "Expected ... but was ..."
+
+**Symptom:** An `IllegalStateException` with a message in the form "Expected ... but was ..." is thrown
+
+**Reason:** The JSON data does not have the correct format
+
+**Solution:** Make sure that your classes correctly model the JSON data. Also during debugging log the JSON data right before calling Gson methods or set a breakpoint to inspect the data and make sure it has the expected format. Read the location information of the exception message, it indicates where exactly in the document the error occurred, including the [JSONPath](https://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/).
+
+For example, let's assume you have the following Java class:
+
+```java
+class WebPage {
+    String languages;
+}
+```
+
+And you want to deserialize the following JSON data:
+
+```json
+{
+  "languages": ["English", "French"]
+}
+```
+
+This will fail with an exception similar to this one: `IllegalStateException: Expected a string but was BEGIN_ARRAY at line 2 column 17 path $.languages`  
+This means Gson expected a JSON string value but found the beginning of a JSON array (`[`). The location information "line 2 column 17" points to the `[` in the JSON data (with some slight inaccuracies), so does the JSONPath `$.languages` in the exception message. It refers to the `languages` member of the root object (`$.`).  
+The solution here is to change in the `WebPage` class the field `String languages` to `List<String> languages`.
+
+## <a id="adapter-not-null-safe"></a> `IllegalStateException`: "Expected ... but was NULL"
+
+**Symptom:** An `IllegalStateException` with a message in the form "Expected ... but was NULL" is thrown
+
+**Reason:**
+
+- A built-in adapter does not support JSON null values
+- You have written a custom `TypeAdapter` which does not properly handle JSON null values
+
+**Solution:** If this occurs for a custom adapter you wrote, add code similar to the following at the beginning of its `read` method:
+
+```java
+@Override
+public MyClass read(JsonReader in) throws IOException {
+    if (in.peek() == JsonToken.NULL) {
+        in.nextNull();
+        return null;
+    }
+
+    ...
+}
+```
+
+Alternatively you can call [`nullSafe()`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html#nullSafe()) on the adapter instance you created.
+
+## <a id="serialize-nulls"></a> Properties missing in JSON
+
+**Symptom:** Properties are missing in the JSON output
+
+**Reason:** Gson by default omits JSON null from the output (or: ProGuard / R8 is not configured correctly and removed unused fields)
+
+**Solution:** Use [`GsonBuilder.serializeNulls()`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.html#serializeNulls())
+
+Note: Gson does not support anonymous and local classes and will serialize them as JSON null, see the [related troubleshooting point](#null-values-for-anonymous-and-local-classes).
+
+## <a id="android-internal-fields"></a> JSON output changes for newer Android versions
+
+**Symptom:** The JSON output differs when running on newer Android versions
+
+**Reason:** You use Gson by accident to access internal fields of Android classes
+
+**Solution:** Write custom Gson [`TypeAdapter`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html) implementations for the affected classes or change the type of your data
+
+**Explanation:**
+
+When no built-in adapter for a type exists and no custom adapter has been registered, Gson falls back to using reflection to access the fields of a class (including `private` ones). Most likely you are experiencing this issue because you (by accident) rely on the reflection-based adapter for Android classes. That should be avoided because you make yourself dependent on the implementation details of these classes which could change at any point.
+
+If you want to prevent using reflection on third-party classes in the future you can write your own [`ReflectionAccessFilter`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/ReflectionAccessFilter.html) or use one of the predefined ones, such as `ReflectionAccessFilter.BLOCK_ALL_PLATFORM`.
+
+## <a id="json-static-fields"></a> JSON output contains values of `static` fields
+
+**Symptom:** The JSON output contains values of `static` fields
+
+**Reason:** You used `GsonBuilder.excludeFieldsWithModifiers` to overwrite the default excluded modifiers
+
+**Solution:** When calling `GsonBuilder.excludeFieldsWithModifiers` you overwrite the default excluded modifiers. Therefore, you have to explicitly exclude `static` fields if desired. This can be done by adding `Modifier.STATIC` as additional argument.
+
+## <a id="no-such-method-error"></a> `NoSuchMethodError` when calling Gson methods
+
+**Symptom:** A `java.lang.NoSuchMethodError` is thrown when trying to call certain Gson methods
+
+**Reason:**
+
+- You have multiple versions of Gson on your classpath
+- Or, the Gson version you compiled against is different from the one on your classpath
+- Or, you are using a code shrinking tool such as ProGuard or R8 which removed methods from Gson
+
+**Solution:** First disable any code shrinking tools such as ProGuard or R8 and check if the issue persists. If not, you have to tweak the configuration of that tool to not modify Gson classes. Otherwise verify that the Gson JAR on your classpath is the same you are compiling against, and that there is only one Gson JAR on your classpath. See [this Stack Overflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/q/227486) to find out where a class is loaded from. For example, for debugging you could include the following code:
+
+```java
+System.out.println(Gson.class.getProtectionDomain().getCodeSource().getLocation());
+```
+
+If that fails with a `NullPointerException` you have to try one of the other ways to find out where a class is loaded from.
+
+## <a id="duplicate-fields"></a> `IllegalArgumentException`: 'Class ... declares multiple JSON fields named '...''
+
+**Symptom:** An exception with the message 'Class ... declares multiple JSON fields named '...'' is thrown
+
+**Reason:**
+
+- The name you have specified with a [`@SerializedName`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/annotations/SerializedName.html) annotation for a field collides with the name of another field
+- The [`FieldNamingStrategy`](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/FieldNamingStrategy.html) you have specified produces conflicting field names
+- A field of your class has the same name as the field of a superclass
+
+Gson prevents multiple fields with the same name because during deserialization it would be ambiguous for which field the JSON data should be deserialized. For serialization it would cause the same field to appear multiple times in JSON. While the JSON specification permits this, it is likely that the application parsing the JSON data will not handle it correctly.
+
+**Solution:** First identify the fields with conflicting names based on the exception message. Then decide if you want to rename one of them using the [`@SerializedName`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/annotations/SerializedName.html) annotation, or if you want to [exclude](UserGuide.md#excluding-fields-from-serialization-and-deserialization) one of them. When excluding one of the fields you have to include it for both serialization and deserialization (even if your application only performs one of these actions) because the duplicate field check cannot differentiate between these actions.
+
+## <a id="java-lang-class-unsupported"></a> `UnsupportedOperationException` when serializing or deserializing `java.lang.Class`
+
+**Symptom:** An `UnsupportedOperationException` is thrown when trying to serialize or deserialize `java.lang.Class`
+
+**Reason:** Gson intentionally does not permit serializing and deserializing `java.lang.Class` for security reasons. Otherwise a malicious user could make your application load an arbitrary class from the classpath and, depending on what your application does with the `Class`, in the worst case perform a remote code execution attack.
+
+**Solution:** First check if you really need to serialize or deserialize a `Class`. Often it is possible to use string aliases and then map them to the known `Class`; you could write a custom [`TypeAdapter`](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html) to do this. If the `Class` values are not known in advance, try to introduce a common base class or interface for all these classes and then verify that the deserialized class is a subclass. For example assuming the base class is called `MyBaseClass`, your custom `TypeAdapter` should load the class like this:
+
+```java
+Class.forName(jsonString, false, getClass().getClassLoader()).asSubclass(MyBaseClass.class)
+```
+
+This will not initialize arbitrary classes, and it will throw a `ClassCastException` if the loaded class is not the same as or a subclass of `MyBaseClass`.
+
+## <a id="type-token-raw"></a> `IllegalStateException`: 'TypeToken must be created with a type argument' <br> `RuntimeException`: 'Missing type parameter'
+
+**Symptom:** An `IllegalStateException` with the message 'TypeToken must be created with a type argument' is thrown.  
+For older Gson versions a `RuntimeException` with message 'Missing type parameter' is thrown.
+
+**Reason:**
+
+- You created a `TypeToken` without type argument, for example `new TypeToken() {}` (note the missing `<...>`). You always have to provide the type argument, for example like this: `new TypeToken<List<String>>() {}`. Normally the compiler will also emit a 'raw types' warning when you forget the `<...>`.
+- You are using a code shrinking tool such as ProGuard or R8 (Android app builds normally have this enabled by default) but have not configured it correctly for usage with Gson.
+
+**Solution:** When you are using a code shrinking tool such as ProGuard or R8 you have to adjust your configuration to include the following rules:
+
+```
+# Keep generic signatures; needed for correct type resolution
+-keepattributes Signature
+
+# Keep class TypeToken (respectively its generic signature)
+-keep class com.google.gson.reflect.TypeToken { *; }
+
+# Keep any (anonymous) classes extending TypeToken
+-keep class * extends com.google.gson.reflect.TypeToken
+```
+
+See also the [Android example](examples/android-proguard-example/README.md) for more information.
+
+Note: For newer Gson versions these rules might be applied automatically; make sure you are using the latest Gson version and the latest version of the code shrinking tool.
+
+## <a id="r8-abstract-class"></a> `JsonIOException`: 'Abstract classes can't be instantiated!' (R8)
+
+**Symptom:** A `JsonIOException` with the message 'Abstract classes can't be instantiated!' is thrown; the class mentioned in the exception message is not actually `abstract` in your source code, and you are using the code shrinking tool R8 (Android app builds normally have this configured by default).
+
+**Reason:** The code shrinking tool R8 performs optimizations where it removes the no-args constructor from a class and makes the class `abstract`. Due to this Gson cannot create an instance of the class.
+
+**Solution:** Prefer keeping the class and all its constructors to prevent R8 from removing constructors or making the class `abstract`. For example:
+
+```
+# Keep the deserialized class and all its constructors
+-keep class com.example.MyClass {
+  <init>(...);
+}
+```
+
+Using `-keep` rather than `-keepclassmembers` helps ensure the class is not made `abstract`, even if a no-args constructor does not exist.
+
+For Kotlin classes it is common to only have a primary constructor. Keeping all constructors avoids unexpected R8 changes, but Gson may still need to use JDK `Unsafe` to create instances if there is no accessible no-args constructor. If you disable `Unsafe` via `GsonBuilder.disableJdkUnsafe()`, deserialization will fail unless you add a no-args constructor or register an `InstanceCreator` or a `TypeAdapter`.
+
+On Android, an easy alternative is to annotate the class or a specific constructor with [`@Keep`](https://developer.android.com/studio/write/annotations#keep).
+
+Newer Gson versions also ship default rules (`META-INF/proguard/gson.pro`) that automatically keep constructors for classes that use Gson annotations (such as `@SerializedName`, `@JsonAdapter`, `@Expose`, `@Since`, `@Until`), reducing the need for custom rules.
+
+For Android you can add custom rules to the `proguard-rules.pro` file; see also the [Android documentation](https://developer.android.com/build/shrink-code#keep-code). In case the class name in the exception message is obfuscated, see the Android documentation about [retracing](https://developer.android.com/build/shrink-code#retracing).
+
+Note: If the class which you are trying to deserialize is actually abstract, then this exception is probably unrelated to R8 and you will have to implement a custom [`InstanceCreator`](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/InstanceCreator.html) or [`TypeAdapter`](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html) which creates an instance of a non-abstract subclass of the class.

-# Troubleshooting Guide
-
-This guide describes how to troubleshoot common issues when using Gson.

-
-## <a id="class-cast-exception"></a> `ClassCastException` when using deserialized object
-
-**Symptom:** `ClassCastException` is thrown when accessing an object deserialized by Gson
-
-**Reason:** Your code is most likely not type-safe
-
-**Solution:** Make sure your code adheres to the following:
-
-- Avoid raw types: Instead of calling `fromJson(..., List.class)`, create for example a `TypeToken<List<MyClass>>`.
-  See the [user guide](UserGuide.md#collections-examples) for more information.
-- When using `TypeToken` prefer the `Gson.fromJson` overloads with `TypeToken` parameter such as [`fromJson(Reader, TypeToken)`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/Gson.html#fromJson(java.io.Reader,com.google.gson.reflect.TypeToken)).
-  The overloads with `Type` parameter do not provide any type-safety guarantees.
-- When using `TypeToken` make sure you don't capture a type variable. For example avoid something like `new TypeToken<List<T>>()` (where `T` is a type variable). Due to Java type erasure the actual type of `T` is not available at runtime. Refactor your code to pass around `TypeToken` instances or use [`TypeToken.getParameterized(...)`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/reflect/TypeToken.html#getParameterized(java.lang.reflect.Type,java.lang.reflect.Type...)), for example `TypeToken.getParameterized(List.class, elementClass)`.
-
-## <a id="reflection-inaccessible"></a> `InaccessibleObjectException`: 'module ... does not "opens ..." to unnamed module'
-
-**Symptom:** An exception with a message in the form 'module ... does not "opens ..." to unnamed module' is thrown
-
-**Reason:** You use Gson by accident to access internal fields of third-party classes
-
-**Solution:** Write custom Gson [`TypeAdapter`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html) implementations for the affected classes or change the type of your data. If this occurs for a field in one of your classes which you did not actually want to serialize or deserialize in the first place, you can exclude that field, see the [user guide](UserGuide.md#excluding-fields-from-serialization-and-deserialization).
-
-**Explanation:**
-
-When no built-in adapter for a type exists and no custom adapter has been registered, Gson falls back to using reflection to access the fields of a class (including `private` ones). Most likely you are seeing this error because you (by accident) rely on the reflection-based adapter for third-party classes. That should be avoided because you make yourself dependent on the implementation details of these classes which could change at any point. For the JDK it is also not possible anymore to access internal fields using reflection starting with JDK 17, see [JEP 403](https://openjdk.org/jeps/403).
-
-If you want to prevent using reflection on third-party classes in the future you can write your own [`ReflectionAccessFilter`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/ReflectionAccessFilter.html) or use one of the predefined ones, such as `ReflectionAccessFilter.BLOCK_ALL_PLATFORM`.
-
-## <a id="reflection-inaccessible-to-module-gson"></a> `InaccessibleObjectException`: 'module ... does not "opens ..." to module com.google.gson'
-
-**Symptom:** An exception with a message in the form 'module ... does not "opens ..." to module com.google.gson' is thrown
-
-**Reason:**
-
-- If the reported package is your own package then you have not configured the module declaration of your project to allow Gson to use reflection on your classes.
-- If the reported package is from a third party library or the JDK see [this troubleshooting point](#inaccessibleobjectexception-module--does-not-opens--to-unnamed-module).
-
-**Solution:** Make sure the `module-info.java` file of your project allows Gson to use reflection on your classes, for example:
-
-```java
-module mymodule {
-    requires com.google.gson;
-
-    opens mypackage to com.google.gson;
-}
-```
-
-Or in case this occurs for a field in one of your classes which you did not actually want to serialize or deserialize in the first place, you can exclude that field, see the [user guide](UserGuide.md#excluding-fields-from-serialization-and-deserialization).
-
-## <a id="android-app-random-names"></a> Android app not working in Release mode; random property names
-
-**Symptom:** Your Android app is working fine in Debug mode but fails in Release mode and the JSON properties have seemingly random names such as `a`, `b`, ...
-
-**Reason:** You probably have not configured ProGuard / R8 correctly
-
-**Solution:** Make sure you have configured ProGuard / R8 correctly to preserve the names of your fields. See the [Android example](examples/android-proguard-example/README.md) for more information.
-
-## <a id="android-app-broken-after-app-update"></a> Android app unable to parse JSON after app update
-
-**Symptom:** You released a new version of your Android app and it fails to parse JSON data created by the previous version of your app
-
-**Reason:** You probably have not configured ProGuard / R8 correctly; probably the fields names are being obfuscated and their naming changed between the versions of your app
-
-**Solution:** Make sure you have configured ProGuard / R8 correctly to preserve the names of your fields. See the [Android example](examples/android-proguard-example/README.md) for more information.
-
-If you want to preserve backward compatibility for you app you can use [`@SerializedName`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/annotations/SerializedName.html) on the fields to specify the obfuscated name as alternate, for example: `@SerializedName(value = "myprop", alternate = "a")`
-
-Normally ProGuard and R8 produce a mapping file, this makes it easier to find out the obfuscated field names instead of having to find them out through trial and error or other means. See the [Android Studio user guide](https://developer.android.com/studio/build/shrink-code.html#retracing) for more information.
-
-## <a id="default-field-values-missing"></a> Default field values not present after deserialization
-
-**Symptom:** You have assign default values to fields but after deserialization the fields have their standard value (such as `null` or `0`)
-
-**Reason:** Gson cannot invoke the constructor of your class and falls back to JDK `Unsafe` (or similar means)
-
-**Solution:** Make sure that the class:
-
-- is `static` (explicitly or implicitly when it is a top-level class)
-- has a no-args constructor
-
-Otherwise Gson will by default try to use JDK `Unsafe` or similar means to create an instance of your class without invoking the constructor and without running any initializers. You can also disable that behavior through [`GsonBuilder.disableJdkUnsafe()`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.html#disableJdkUnsafe()) to notice such issues early on.
-
-## <a id="anonymous-local-null"></a> `null` values for anonymous and local classes
-
-**Symptom:** Objects of a class are always serialized as JSON `null` / always deserialized as Java `null`
-
-**Reason:** The class you are serializing or deserializing is an anonymous or a local class (or you have specified a custom `ExclusionStrategy`)
-
-**Solution:** Convert the class to a `static` nested class. If the class is already `static` make sure you have not specified a Gson `ExclusionStrategy` which might exclude the class.
-
-Notes:
-
-- "double brace-initialization" also creates anonymous classes
-- Local record classes (feature added in Java 16) are supported by Gson and are not affected by this
-
-## <a id="map-key-wrong-json"></a> Map keys having unexpected format in JSON
-
-**Symptom:** JSON output for `Map` keys is unexpected / cannot be deserialized again
-
-**Reason:** The `Map` key type is 'complex' and you have not configured the `GsonBuilder` properly
-
-**Solution:** Use [`GsonBuilder.enableComplexMapKeySerialization()`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.html#enableComplexMapKeySerialization()). See also the [user guide](UserGuide.md#maps-examples) for more information.
-
-## <a id="malformed-json"></a> Parsing JSON fails with `MalformedJsonException`
-
-**Symptom:** JSON parsing fails with `MalformedJsonException`
-
-**Reason:** The JSON data is actually malformed
-
-**Solution:** During debugging, log the JSON data right before calling Gson methods or set a breakpoint to inspect the data and make sure it has the expected format. Sometimes APIs might return HTML error pages (instead of JSON data) when reaching rate limits or when other errors occur. Also read the location information of the `MalformedJsonException` exception message, it indicates where exactly in the document the malformed data was detected, including the [JSONPath](https://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/).
-
-For example, let's assume you want to deserialize the following JSON data:
-
-```json
-{
-  "languages": [
-    "English",
-    "French",
-  ]
-}
-```
-
-This will fail with an exception similar to this one: `MalformedJsonException: Use JsonReader.setLenient(true) to accept malformed JSON at line 5 column 4 path $.languages[2]`  
-The problem here is the trailing comma (`,`) after `"French"`, trailing commas are not allowed by the JSON specification. The location information "line 5 column 4" points to the `]` in the JSON data (with some slight inaccuracies) because Gson expected another value after `,` instead of the closing `]`. The JSONPath `$.languages[2]` in the exception message also points there: `$.` refers to the root object, `languages` refers to its member of that name and `[2]` refers to the (missing) third value in the JSON array value of that member (numbering starts at 0, so it is `[2]` instead of `[3]`).  
-The proper solution here is to fix the malformed JSON data.
-
-To spot syntax errors in the JSON data easily you can open it in an editor with support for JSON, for example Visual Studio Code. It will highlight within the JSON data the error location and show why the JSON data is considered invalid.
-
-## <a id="number-parsed-as-double"></a> Integral JSON number is parsed as `double`
-
-**Symptom:** JSON data contains an integral number such as `45` but Gson returns it as `double`
-
-**Reason:** When parsing a JSON number as `Object`, Gson will by default create always return a `double`
-
-**Solution:** Use [`GsonBuilder.setObjectToNumberStrategy`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.html#setObjectToNumberStrategy(com.google.gson.ToNumberStrategy)) to specify what type of number should be returned
-
-## <a id="default-lenient"></a> Malformed JSON not rejected
-
-**Symptom:** Gson parses malformed JSON without throwing any exceptions
-
-**Reason:** Due to legacy reasons Gson performs parsing by default in lenient mode
-
-**Solution:** See [`Gson` class documentation](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/Gson.html#default-lenient) section "Lenient JSON handling"
-
-Note: Even in non-lenient mode Gson deviates slightly from the JSON specification, see [`JsonReader.setLenient`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/stream/JsonReader.html#setLenient(boolean)) for more details.
-
-## <a id="unexpected-json-structure"></a> `IllegalStateException`: "Expected ... but was ..."
-
-**Symptom:** An `IllegalStateException` with a message in the form "Expected ... but was ..." is thrown
-
-**Reason:** The JSON data does not have the correct format
-
-**Solution:** Make sure that your classes correctly model the JSON data. Also during debugging log the JSON data right before calling Gson methods or set a breakpoint to inspect the data and make sure it has the expected format. Read the location information of the exception message, it indicates where exactly in the document the error occurred, including the [JSONPath](https://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/).
-
-For example, let's assume you have the following Java class:
-
-```java
-class WebPage {
-    String languages;
-}
-```
-
-And you want to deserialize the following JSON data:
-
-```json
-{
-  "languages": ["English", "French"]
-}
-```
-
-This will fail with an exception similar to this one: `IllegalStateException: Expected a string but was BEGIN_ARRAY at line 2 column 17 path $.languages`  
-This means Gson expected a JSON string value but found the beginning of a JSON array (`[`). The location information "line 2 column 17" points to the `[` in the JSON data (with some slight inaccuracies), so does the JSONPath `$.languages` in the exception message. It refers to the `languages` member of the root object (`$.`).  
-The solution here is to change in the `WebPage` class the field `String languages` to `List<String> languages`.
-
-## <a id="adapter-not-null-safe"></a> `IllegalStateException`: "Expected ... but was NULL"
-
-**Symptom:** An `IllegalStateException` with a message in the form "Expected ... but was NULL" is thrown
-
-**Reason:**
-
-- A built-in adapter does not support JSON null values
-- You have written a custom `TypeAdapter` which does not properly handle JSON null values
-
-**Solution:** If this occurs for a custom adapter you wrote, add code similar to the following at the beginning of its `read` method:
-
-```java
-@Override
-public MyClass read(JsonReader in) throws IOException {
-    if (in.peek() == JsonToken.NULL) {
-        in.nextNull();
-        return null;
-    }
-
-    ...
-}
-```
-
-Alternatively you can call [`nullSafe()`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html#nullSafe()) on the adapter instance you created.
-
-## <a id="serialize-nulls"></a> Properties missing in JSON
-
-**Symptom:** Properties are missing in the JSON output
-
-**Reason:** Gson by default omits JSON null from the output (or: ProGuard / R8 is not configured correctly and removed unused fields)
-
-**Solution:** Use [`GsonBuilder.serializeNulls()`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.html#serializeNulls())
-
-Note: Gson does not support anonymous and local classes and will serialize them as JSON null, see the [related troubleshooting point](#null-values-for-anonymous-and-local-classes).
-
-## <a id="android-internal-fields"></a> JSON output changes for newer Android versions
-
-**Symptom:** The JSON output differs when running on newer Android versions
-
-**Reason:** You use Gson by accident to access internal fields of Android classes
-
-**Solution:** Write custom Gson [`TypeAdapter`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html) implementations for the affected classes or change the type of your data
-
-**Explanation:**
-
-When no built-in adapter for a type exists and no custom adapter has been registered, Gson falls back to using reflection to access the fields of a class (including `private` ones). Most likely you are experiencing this issue because you (by accident) rely on the reflection-based adapter for Android classes. That should be avoided because you make yourself dependent on the implementation details of these classes which could change at any point.
-
-If you want to prevent using reflection on third-party classes in the future you can write your own [`ReflectionAccessFilter`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/ReflectionAccessFilter.html) or use one of the predefined ones, such as `ReflectionAccessFilter.BLOCK_ALL_PLATFORM`.
-
-## <a id="json-static-fields"></a> JSON output contains values of `static` fields
-
-**Symptom:** The JSON output contains values of `static` fields
-
-**Reason:** You used `GsonBuilder.excludeFieldsWithModifiers` to overwrite the default excluded modifiers
-
-**Solution:** When calling `GsonBuilder.excludeFieldsWithModifiers` you overwrite the default excluded modifiers. Therefore, you have to explicitly exclude `static` fields if desired. This can be done by adding `Modifier.STATIC` as additional argument.
-
-## <a id="no-such-method-error"></a> `NoSuchMethodError` when calling Gson methods
-
-**Symptom:** A `java.lang.NoSuchMethodError` is thrown when trying to call certain Gson methods
-
-**Reason:**
-
-- You have multiple versions of Gson on your classpath
-- Or, the Gson version you compiled against is different from the one on your classpath
-- Or, you are using a code shrinking tool such as ProGuard or R8 which removed methods from Gson
-
-**Solution:** First disable any code shrinking tools such as ProGuard or R8 and check if the issue persists. If not, you have to tweak the configuration of that tool to not modify Gson classes. Otherwise verify that the Gson JAR on your classpath is the same you are compiling against, and that there is only one Gson JAR on your classpath. See [this Stack Overflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/q/227486) to find out where a class is loaded from. For example, for debugging you could include the following code:
-
-```java
-System.out.println(Gson.class.getProtectionDomain().getCodeSource().getLocation());
-```
-
-If that fails with a `NullPointerException` you have to try one of the other ways to find out where a class is loaded from.
-
-## <a id="duplicate-fields"></a> `IllegalArgumentException`: 'Class ... declares multiple JSON fields named '...''
-
-**Symptom:** An exception with the message 'Class ... declares multiple JSON fields named '...'' is thrown
-
-**Reason:**
-
-- The name you have specified with a [`@SerializedName`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/annotations/SerializedName.html) annotation for a field collides with the name of another field
-- The [`FieldNamingStrategy`](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/FieldNamingStrategy.html) you have specified produces conflicting field names
-- A field of your class has the same name as the field of a superclass
-
-Gson prevents multiple fields with the same name because during deserialization it would be ambiguous for which field the JSON data should be deserialized. For serialization it would cause the same field to appear multiple times in JSON. While the JSON specification permits this, it is likely that the application parsing the JSON data will not handle it correctly.
-
-**Solution:** First identify the fields with conflicting names based on the exception message. Then decide if you want to rename one of them using the [`@SerializedName`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/annotations/SerializedName.html) annotation, or if you want to [exclude](UserGuide.md#excluding-fields-from-serialization-and-deserialization) one of them. When excluding one of the fields you have to include it for both serialization and deserialization (even if your application only performs one of these actions) because the duplicate field check cannot differentiate between these actions.
-
-## <a id="java-lang-class-unsupported"></a> `UnsupportedOperationException` when serializing or deserializing `java.lang.Class`
-
-**Symptom:** An `UnsupportedOperationException` is thrown when trying to serialize or deserialize `java.lang.Class`
-
-**Reason:** Gson intentionally does not permit serializing and deserializing `java.lang.Class` for security reasons. Otherwise a malicious user could make your application load an arbitrary class from the classpath and, depending on what your application does with the `Class`, in the worst case perform a remote code execution attack.
-
-**Solution:** First check if you really need to serialize or deserialize a `Class`. Often it is possible to use string aliases and then map them to the known `Class`; you could write a custom [`TypeAdapter`](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html) to do this. If the `Class` values are not known in advance, try to introduce a common base class or interface for all these classes and then verify that the deserialized class is a subclass. For example assuming the base class is called `MyBaseClass`, your custom `TypeAdapter` should load the class like this:
-
-```java
-Class.forName(jsonString, false, getClass().getClassLoader()).asSubclass(MyBaseClass.class)
-```
-
-This will not initialize arbitrary classes, and it will throw a `ClassCastException` if the loaded class is not the same as or a subclass of `MyBaseClass`.
-
-## <a id="type-token-raw"></a> `IllegalStateException`: 'TypeToken must be created with a type argument' <br> `RuntimeException`: 'Missing type parameter'
-
-**Symptom:** An `IllegalStateException` with the message 'TypeToken must be created with a type argument' is thrown.  
-For older Gson versions a `RuntimeException` with message 'Missing type parameter' is thrown.
-
-**Reason:**
-
-- You created a `TypeToken` without type argument, for example `new TypeToken() {}` (note the missing `<...>`). You always have to provide the type argument, for example like this: `new TypeToken<List<String>>() {}`. Normally the compiler will also emit a 'raw types' warning when you forget the `<...>`.
-- You are using a code shrinking tool such as ProGuard or R8 (Android app builds normally have this enabled by default) but have not configured it correctly for usage with Gson.
-
-**Solution:** When you are using a code shrinking tool such as ProGuard or R8 you have to adjust your configuration to include the following rules:
-
-```
-# Keep generic signatures; needed for correct type resolution
--keepattributes Signature
-
-# Keep class TypeToken (respectively its generic signature)
--keep class com.google.gson.reflect.TypeToken { *; }
-
-# Keep any (anonymous) classes extending TypeToken
--keep class * extends com.google.gson.reflect.TypeToken
-```
-
-See also the [Android example](examples/android-proguard-example/README.md) for more information.
-
-Note: For newer Gson versions these rules might be applied automatically; make sure you are using the latest Gson version and the latest version of the code shrinking tool.
-
-## <a id="r8-abstract-class"></a> `JsonIOException`: 'Abstract classes can't be instantiated!' (R8)
-
-**Symptom:** A `JsonIOException` with the message 'Abstract classes can't be instantiated!' is thrown; the class mentioned in the exception message is not actually `abstract` in your source code, and you are using the code shrinking tool R8 (Android app builds normally have this configured by default).
-
-**Reason:** The code shrinking tool R8 performs optimizations where it removes the no-args constructor from a class and makes the class `abstract`. Due to this Gson cannot create an instance of the class.
-
-**Solution:** Make sure the class has a no-args constructor, then adjust your R8 configuration file to keep the constructor of the class. For example:
-
-```
-# Keep the no-args constructor of the deserialized class
--keepclassmembers class com.example.MyClass {
-  <init>();
-}
-```
-
-For Android you can add this rule to the `proguard-rules.pro` file, see also the [Android documentation](https://developer.android.com/build/shrink-code#keep-code). In case the class name in the exception message is obfuscated, see the Android documentation about [retracing](https://developer.android.com/build/shrink-code#retracing).
-
-Note: If the class which you are trying to deserialize is actually abstract, then this exception is probably unrelated to R8 and you will have to implement a custom [`InstanceCreator`](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/InstanceCreator.html) or [`TypeAdapter`](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html) which creates an instance of a non-abstract subclass of the class.

+
+## <a id="reflection-inaccessible"></a> `InaccessibleObjectException`: 'module ... does not "opens ..." to unnamed module'
+
+**Symptom:** An exception with a message in the form 'module ... does not "opens ..." to unnamed module' is thrown
+
+**Reason:** You use Gson by accident to access internal fields of third-party classes

+## <a id="reflection-inaccessible-to-module-gson"></a> `InaccessibleObjectException`: 'module ... does not "opens ..." to module com.google.gson'
+
+**Symptom:** An exception with a message in the form 'module ... does not "opens ..." to module com.google.gson' is thrown
+
+**Reason:**
+
+- If the reported package is your own package then you have not configured the module declaration of your project to allow Gson to use reflection on your classes.
+- If the reported package is from a third party library or the JDK see [this troubleshooting point](#inaccessibleobjectexception-module--does-not-opens--to-unnamed-module).
+
+**Solution:** Make sure the `module-info.java` file of your project allows Gson to use reflection on your classes, for example:
+
+```java
+module mymodule {
+    requires com.google.gson;
+
+    opens mypackage to com.google.gson;
+}
+```
+
+Or in case this occurs for a field in one of your classes which you did not actually want to serialize or deserialize in the first place, you can exclude that field, see the [user guide](UserGuide.md#excluding-fields-from-serialization-and-deserialization).
+
+## <a id="android-app-random-names"></a> Android app not working in Release mode; random property names
+
+**Symptom:** Your Android app is working fine in Debug mode but fails in Release mode and the JSON properties have seemingly random names such as `a`, `b`, ...
+
+**Reason:** You probably have not configured ProGuard / R8 correctly
+
+**Solution:** Make sure you have configured ProGuard / R8 correctly to preserve the names of your fields. See the [Android example](examples/android-proguard-example/README.md) for more information.
+
+## <a id="android-app-broken-after-app-update"></a> Android app unable to parse JSON after app update
+
+**Symptom:** You released a new version of your Android app and it fails to parse JSON data created by the previous version of your app
+
+**Reason:** You probably have not configured ProGuard / R8 correctly; probably the fields names are being obfuscated and their naming changed between the versions of your app
+
+**Solution:** Make sure you have configured ProGuard / R8 correctly to preserve the names of your fields. See the [Android example](examples/android-proguard-example/README.md) for more information.
+
+If you want to preserve backward compatibility for you app you can use [`@SerializedName`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/annotations/SerializedName.html) on the fields to specify the obfuscated name as alternate, for example: `@SerializedName(value = "myprop", alternate = "a")`
+
+Normally ProGuard and R8 produce a mapping file, this makes it easier to find out the obfuscated field names instead of having to find them out through trial and error or other means. See the [Android Studio user guide](https://developer.android.com/studio/build/shrink-code.html#retracing) for more information.
+
+## <a id="default-field-values-missing"></a> Default field values not present after deserialization
+
+**Symptom:** You have assign default values to fields but after deserialization the fields have their standard value (such as `null` or `0`)
+
+**Reason:** Gson cannot invoke the constructor of your class and falls back to JDK `Unsafe` (or similar means)
+
+**Solution:** Make sure that the class:
+
+- is `static` (explicitly or implicitly when it is a top-level class)
+- has a no-args constructor
+
+Otherwise Gson will by default try to use JDK `Unsafe` or similar means to create an instance of your class without invoking the constructor and without running any initializers. You can also disable that behavior through [`GsonBuilder.disableJdkUnsafe()`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.html#disableJdkUnsafe()) to notice such issues early on.
+
+## <a id="anonymous-local-null"></a> `null` values for anonymous and local classes
+
+**Symptom:** Objects of a class are always serialized as JSON `null` / always deserialized as Java `null`
+
+**Reason:** The class you are serializing or deserializing is an anonymous or a local class (or you have specified a custom `ExclusionStrategy`)
+
+**Solution:** Convert the class to a `static` nested class. If the class is already `static` make sure you have not specified a Gson `ExclusionStrategy` which might exclude the class.
+
+Notes:
+
+- "double brace-initialization" also creates anonymous classes
+- Local record classes (feature added in Java 16) are supported by Gson and are not affected by this
+
+## <a id="map-key-wrong-json"></a> Map keys having unexpected format in JSON
+
+**Symptom:** JSON output for `Map` keys is unexpected / cannot be deserialized again
+
+**Reason:** The `Map` key type is 'complex' and you have not configured the `GsonBuilder` properly
+
+**Solution:** Use [`GsonBuilder.enableComplexMapKeySerialization()`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.html#enableComplexMapKeySerialization()). See also the [user guide](UserGuide.md#maps-examples) for more information.
+
+## <a id="malformed-json"></a> Parsing JSON fails with `MalformedJsonException`
+
+**Symptom:** JSON parsing fails with `MalformedJsonException`
+
+**Reason:** The JSON data is actually malformed
+
+**Solution:** During debugging, log the JSON data right before calling Gson methods or set a breakpoint to inspect the data and make sure it has the expected format. Sometimes APIs might return HTML error pages (instead of JSON data) when reaching rate limits or when other errors occur. Also read the location information of the `MalformedJsonException` exception message, it indicates where exactly in the document the malformed data was detected, including the [JSONPath](https://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/).
+
+For example, let's assume you want to deserialize the following JSON data:
+
+```json
+{
+  "languages": [
+    "English",
+    "French",
+  ]
+}
+```
+
+This will fail with an exception similar to this one: `MalformedJsonException: Use JsonReader.setLenient(true) to accept malformed JSON at line 5 column 4 path $.languages[2]`  
+The problem here is the trailing comma (`,`) after `"French"`, trailing commas are not allowed by the JSON specification. The location information "line 5 column 4" points to the `]` in the JSON data (with some slight inaccuracies) because Gson expected another value after `,` instead of the closing `]`. The JSONPath `$.languages[2]` in the exception message also points there: `$.` refers to the root object, `languages` refers to its member of that name and `[2]` refers to the (missing) third value in the JSON array value of that member (numbering starts at 0, so it is `[2]` instead of `[3]`).  
+The proper solution here is to fix the malformed JSON data.
+
+To spot syntax errors in the JSON data easily you can open it in an editor with support for JSON, for example Visual Studio Code. It will highlight within the JSON data the error location and show why the JSON data is considered invalid.
+
+## <a id="number-parsed-as-double"></a> Integral JSON number is parsed as `double`
+
+**Symptom:** JSON data contains an integral number such as `45` but Gson returns it as `double`
+
+**Reason:** When parsing a JSON number as `Object`, Gson will by default create always return a `double`
+
+**Solution:** Use [`GsonBuilder.setObjectToNumberStrategy`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.html#setObjectToNumberStrategy(com.google.gson.ToNumberStrategy)) to specify what type of number should be returned
+
+## <a id="default-lenient"></a> Malformed JSON not rejected
+
+**Symptom:** Gson parses malformed JSON without throwing any exceptions
+
+**Reason:** Due to legacy reasons Gson performs parsing by default in lenient mode
+
+**Solution:** See [`Gson` class documentation](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/Gson.html#default-lenient) section "Lenient JSON handling"
+
+Note: Even in non-lenient mode Gson deviates slightly from the JSON specification, see [`JsonReader.setLenient`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/stream/JsonReader.html#setLenient(boolean)) for more details.
+
+## <a id="unexpected-json-structure"></a> `IllegalStateException`: "Expected ... but was ..."
+
+**Symptom:** An `IllegalStateException` with a message in the form "Expected ... but was ..." is thrown
+
+**Reason:** The JSON data does not have the correct format
+
+**Solution:** Make sure that your classes correctly model the JSON data. Also during debugging log the JSON data right before calling Gson methods or set a breakpoint to inspect the data and make sure it has the expected format. Read the location information of the exception message, it indicates where exactly in the document the error occurred, including the [JSONPath](https://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/).
+
+For example, let's assume you have the following Java class:
+
+```java
+class WebPage {
+    String languages;
+}
+```
+
+And you want to deserialize the following JSON data:
+
+```json
+{
+  "languages": ["English", "French"]
+}
+```
+
+This will fail with an exception similar to this one: `IllegalStateException: Expected a string but was BEGIN_ARRAY at line 2 column 17 path $.languages`  
+This means Gson expected a JSON string value but found the beginning of a JSON array (`[`). The location information "line 2 column 17" points to the `[` in the JSON data (with some slight inaccuracies), so does the JSONPath `$.languages` in the exception message. It refers to the `languages` member of the root object (`$.`).  
+The solution here is to change in the `WebPage` class the field `String languages` to `List<String> languages`.
+
+## <a id="adapter-not-null-safe"></a> `IllegalStateException`: "Expected ... but was NULL"
+
+**Symptom:** An `IllegalStateException` with a message in the form "Expected ... but was NULL" is thrown
+
+**Reason:**
+
+- A built-in adapter does not support JSON null values
+- You have written a custom `TypeAdapter` which does not properly handle JSON null values
+
+**Solution:** If this occurs for a custom adapter you wrote, add code similar to the following at the beginning of its `read` method:
+
+```java
+@Override
+public MyClass read(JsonReader in) throws IOException {
+    if (in.peek() == JsonToken.NULL) {
+        in.nextNull();
+        return null;
+    }
+
+    ...
+}
+```
+
+Alternatively you can call [`nullSafe()`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html#nullSafe()) on the adapter instance you created.
+
+## <a id="serialize-nulls"></a> Properties missing in JSON
+
+**Symptom:** Properties are missing in the JSON output
+
+**Reason:** Gson by default omits JSON null from the output (or: ProGuard / R8 is not configured correctly and removed unused fields)
+
+**Solution:** Use [`GsonBuilder.serializeNulls()`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.html#serializeNulls())
+
+Note: Gson does not support anonymous and local classes and will serialize them as JSON null, see the [related troubleshooting point](#null-values-for-anonymous-and-local-classes).
+
+## <a id="android-internal-fields"></a> JSON output changes for newer Android versions
+
+**Symptom:** The JSON output differs when running on newer Android versions
+
+**Reason:** You use Gson by accident to access internal fields of Android classes
+
+**Solution:** Write custom Gson [`TypeAdapter`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html) implementations for the affected classes or change the type of your data
+
+**Explanation:**
+
+When no built-in adapter for a type exists and no custom adapter has been registered, Gson falls back to using reflection to access the fields of a class (including `private` ones). Most likely you are experiencing this issue because you (by accident) rely on the reflection-based adapter for Android classes. That should be avoided because you make yourself dependent on the implementation details of these classes which could change at any point.
+
+If you want to prevent using reflection on third-party classes in the future you can write your own [`ReflectionAccessFilter`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/ReflectionAccessFilter.html) or use one of the predefined ones, such as `ReflectionAccessFilter.BLOCK_ALL_PLATFORM`.
+
+## <a id="json-static-fields"></a> JSON output contains values of `static` fields
+
+**Symptom:** The JSON output contains values of `static` fields
+
+**Reason:** You used `GsonBuilder.excludeFieldsWithModifiers` to overwrite the default excluded modifiers
+
+**Solution:** When calling `GsonBuilder.excludeFieldsWithModifiers` you overwrite the default excluded modifiers. Therefore, you have to explicitly exclude `static` fields if desired. This can be done by adding `Modifier.STATIC` as additional argument.
+
+## <a id="no-such-method-error"></a> `NoSuchMethodError` when calling Gson methods
+
+**Symptom:** A `java.lang.NoSuchMethodError` is thrown when trying to call certain Gson methods
+
+**Reason:**
+
+- You have multiple versions of Gson on your classpath
+- Or, the Gson version you compiled against is different from the one on your classpath
+- Or, you are using a code shrinking tool such as ProGuard or R8 which removed methods from Gson
+
+**Solution:** First disable any code shrinking tools such as ProGuard or R8 and check if the issue persists. If not, you have to tweak the configuration of that tool to not modify Gson classes. Otherwise verify that the Gson JAR on your classpath is the same you are compiling against, and that there is only one Gson JAR on your classpath. See [this Stack Overflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/q/227486) to find out where a class is loaded from. For example, for debugging you could include the following code:
+
+```java
+System.out.println(Gson.class.getProtectionDomain().getCodeSource().getLocation());
+```
+
+If that fails with a `NullPointerException` you have to try one of the other ways to find out where a class is loaded from.
+
+## <a id="duplicate-fields"></a> `IllegalArgumentException`: 'Class ... declares multiple JSON fields named '...''
+
+**Symptom:** An exception with the message 'Class ... declares multiple JSON fields named '...'' is thrown
+
+**Reason:**
+
+- The name you have specified with a [`@SerializedName`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/annotations/SerializedName.html) annotation for a field collides with the name of another field
+- The [`FieldNamingStrategy`](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/FieldNamingStrategy.html) you have specified produces conflicting field names
+- A field of your class has the same name as the field of a superclass
+
+Gson prevents multiple fields with the same name because during deserialization it would be ambiguous for which field the JSON data should be deserialized. For serialization it would cause the same field to appear multiple times in JSON. While the JSON specification permits this, it is likely that the application parsing the JSON data will not handle it correctly.
+
+**Solution:** First identify the fields with conflicting names based on the exception message. Then decide if you want to rename one of them using the [`@SerializedName`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/annotations/SerializedName.html) annotation, or if you want to [exclude](UserGuide.md#excluding-fields-from-serialization-and-deserialization) one of them. When excluding one of the fields you have to include it for both serialization and deserialization (even if your application only performs one of these actions) because the duplicate field check cannot differentiate between these actions.
+
+## <a id="java-lang-class-unsupported"></a> `UnsupportedOperationException` when serializing or deserializing `java.lang.Class`
+
+**Symptom:** An `UnsupportedOperationException` is thrown when trying to serialize or deserialize `java.lang.Class`
+
+**Reason:** Gson intentionally does not permit serializing and deserializing `java.lang.Class` for security reasons. Otherwise a malicious user could make your application load an arbitrary class from the classpath and, depending on what your application does with the `Class`, in the worst case perform a remote code execution attack.
+
+**Solution:** First check if you really need to serialize or deserialize a `Class`. Often it is possible to use string aliases and then map them to the known `Class`; you could write a custom [`TypeAdapter`](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html) to do this. If the `Class` values are not known in advance, try to introduce a common base class or interface for all these classes and then verify that the deserialized class is a subclass. For example assuming the base class is called `MyBaseClass`, your custom `TypeAdapter` should load the class like this:
+
+```java
+Class.forName(jsonString, false, getClass().getClassLoader()).asSubclass(MyBaseClass.class)
+```
+
+This will not initialize arbitrary classes, and it will throw a `ClassCastException` if the loaded class is not the same as or a subclass of `MyBaseClass`.
+
+## <a id="type-token-raw"></a> `IllegalStateException`: 'TypeToken must be created with a type argument' <br> `RuntimeException`: 'Missing type parameter'
+
+**Symptom:** An `IllegalStateException` with the message 'TypeToken must be created with a type argument' is thrown.  
+For older Gson versions a `RuntimeException` with message 'Missing type parameter' is thrown.
+
+**Reason:**
+
+- You created a `TypeToken` without type argument, for example `new TypeToken() {}` (note the missing `<...>`). You always have to provide the type argument, for example like this: `new TypeToken<List<String>>() {}`. Normally the compiler will also emit a 'raw types' warning when you forget the `<...>`.
+- You are using a code shrinking tool such as ProGuard or R8 (Android app builds normally have this enabled by default) but have not configured it correctly for usage with Gson.
+
+**Solution:** When you are using a code shrinking tool such as ProGuard or R8 you have to adjust your configuration to include the following rules:
+
+```
+# Keep generic signatures; needed for correct type resolution
+-keepattributes Signature
+
+# Keep class TypeToken (respectively its generic signature)
+-keep class com.google.gson.reflect.TypeToken { *; }
+
+# Keep any (anonymous) classes extending TypeToken
+-keep class * extends com.google.gson.reflect.TypeToken
+```
+
+See also the [Android example](examples/android-proguard-example/README.md) for more information.
+
+Note: For newer Gson versions these rules might be applied automatically; make sure you are using the latest Gson version and the latest version of the code shrinking tool.
+
+## <a id="r8-abstract-class"></a> `JsonIOException`: 'Abstract classes can't be instantiated!' (R8)
+
+**Symptom:** A `JsonIOException` with the message 'Abstract classes can't be instantiated!' is thrown; the class mentioned in the exception message is not actually `abstract` in your source code, and you are using the code shrinking tool R8 (Android app builds normally have this configured by default).
+
+**Reason:** The code shrinking tool R8 performs optimizations where it may remove constructors and make classes `abstract`. Due to this Gson cannot create an instance of the class.
+
+**Solution:** Prefer keeping all constructors of the affected class. This is more robust for Kotlin, where classes commonly have a primary constructor and no no-args constructor.
+
+```
+# Keep all constructors of the deserialized class
+-keep class com.example.MyClass {
+  <init>(...);
+}
+```
+
+If you specifically rely on a no-args constructor, you can keep only that constructor, but ensure it actually exists:
+
+```
+# Keep the no-args constructor of the deserialized class
+-keepclassmembers class com.example.MyClass {
+  <init>();
+}
+```
+
+Alternatively for Android, you can annotate the class or its constructor with `@Keep` to avoid writing explicit ProGuard/R8 rules. See the Android documentation: https://developer.android.com/studio/write/annotations#keep
+
+Notes:
+
+- If R8 makes the class `abstract`, Gson cannot instantiate it even if constructors are present. Keeping the class (via `-keep` or `-keepclasseswithmembers`) and its constructors helps prevent this optimization.
+- If Gson cannot call a constructor (for example if none exists or is inaccessible), it may fall back to using JDK Unsafe to allocate instances without running constructors and initializers. This can result in missing default field values. You can disable this behavior via `GsonBuilder.disableJdkUnsafe()` to fail fast and surface configuration issues.
+- If the class which you are trying to deserialize is actually abstract in source, this exception is unrelated to R8. Implement a custom [`InstanceCreator`](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/InstanceCreator.html) or [`TypeAdapter`](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html) which creates an instance of a non-abstract subclass.
+
+For Android you can add these rules to the `proguard-rules.pro` file, see also the [Android documentation](https://developer.android.com/build/shrink-code#keep-code). In case the class name in the exception message is obfuscated, see the Android documentation about [retracing](https://developer.android.com/build/shrink-code#retracing).

This helps prevent R8 from making classes abstract or removing constructors that Gson may need, especially for Kotlin classes with non-default constructors.\n- The rules allow obfuscation of class and member names unless explicitly needed.\n\n**Troubleshooting Guide:**\n- The guide now recommends keeping all constructors for classes used with Gson, not just the no-args constructor. This is especially relevant for Kotlin classes and cases where constructor logic is important.\n- It explains the difference between `-keepclassmembers` and `-keepclasseswithmembers`, and when to use each.\n- It adds references to using Android's `@Keep` annotation as an alternative to ProGuard/R8 rules.\n- The section on R8-related abstract class errors has been expanded with practical advice and alternatives.\n\n**Other Updates:**\n- The Android example README has been updated with additional guidance for Kotlin, annotation-based retention, and `@Keep` usage.\n- Exception messages now always reference the Troubleshooting Guide when R8-related issues are detected, regardless of constructor presence.\n\n**Verification:**\n- All regression tests have passed successfully, confirming the changes work as intended.\n\nThis is an initial implementation and further refinements may be made as new scenarios arise.

-# Troubleshooting Guide
-
-This guide describes how to troubleshoot common issues when using Gson.
-
-<!-- The '<a id="..."></a>' anchors below are used to create stable links; don't remove or rename them -->

-## <a id="class-cast-exception"></a> `ClassCastException` when using deserialized object
-
-**Symptom:** `ClassCastException` is thrown when accessing an object deserialized by Gson
-
-**Reason:** Your code is most likely not type-safe
-
-**Solution:** Make sure your code adheres to the following:
-
-- Avoid raw types: Instead of calling `fromJson(..., List.class)`, create for example a `TypeToken<List<MyClass>>`.
-  See the [user guide](UserGuide.md#collections-examples) for more information.
-- When using `TypeToken` prefer the `Gson.fromJson` overloads with `TypeToken` parameter such as [`fromJson(Reader, TypeToken)`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/Gson.html#fromJson(java.io.Reader,com.google.gson.reflect.TypeToken)).
-  The overloads with `Type` parameter do not provide any type-safety guarantees.
-- When using `TypeToken` make sure you don't capture a type variable. For example avoid something like `new TypeToken<List<T>>()` (where `T` is a type variable). Due to Java type erasure the actual type of `T` is not available at runtime. Refactor your code to pass around `TypeToken` instances or use [`TypeToken.getParameterized(...)`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/reflect/TypeToken.html#getParameterized(java.lang.reflect.Type,java.lang.reflect.Type...)), for example `TypeToken.getParameterized(List.class, elementClass)`.
-
-## <a id="reflection-inaccessible"></a> `InaccessibleObjectException`: 'module ... does not "opens ..." to unnamed module'
-
-**Symptom:** An exception with a message in the form 'module ... does not "opens ..." to unnamed module' is thrown
-
-**Reason:** You use Gson by accident to access internal fields of third-party classes
-
-**Solution:** Write custom Gson [`TypeAdapter`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html) implementations for the affected classes or change the type of your data. If this occurs for a field in one of your classes which you did not actually want to serialize or deserialize in the first place, you can exclude that field, see the [user guide](UserGuide.md#excluding-fields-from-serialization-and-deserialization).
-
-**Explanation:**
-
-When no built-in adapter for a type exists and no custom adapter has been registered, Gson falls back to using reflection to access the fields of a class (including `private` ones). Most likely you are seeing this error because you (by accident) rely on the reflection-based adapter for third-party classes. That should be avoided because you make yourself dependent on the implementation details of these classes which could change at any point. For the JDK it is also not possible anymore to access internal fields using reflection starting with JDK 17, see [JEP 403](https://openjdk.org/jeps/403).
-
-If you want to prevent using reflection on third-party classes in the future you can write your own [`ReflectionAccessFilter`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/ReflectionAccessFilter.html) or use one of the predefined ones, such as `ReflectionAccessFilter.BLOCK_ALL_PLATFORM`.
-
-## <a id="reflection-inaccessible-to-module-gson"></a> `InaccessibleObjectException`: 'module ... does not "opens ..." to module com.google.gson'
-
-**Symptom:** An exception with a message in the form 'module ... does not "opens ..." to module com.google.gson' is thrown
-
-**Reason:**
-
-- If the reported package is your own package then you have not configured the module declaration of your project to allow Gson to use reflection on your classes.
-- If the reported package is from a third party library or the JDK see [this troubleshooting point](#inaccessibleobjectexception-module--does-not-opens--to-unnamed-module).
-
-**Solution:** Make sure the `module-info.java` file of your project allows Gson to use reflection on your classes, for example:
-
-```java
-module mymodule {
-    requires com.google.gson;
-
-    opens mypackage to com.google.gson;
-}
-```
-
-Or in case this occurs for a field in one of your classes which you did not actually want to serialize or deserialize in the first place, you can exclude that field, see the [user guide](UserGuide.md#excluding-fields-from-serialization-and-deserialization).
-
-## <a id="android-app-random-names"></a> Android app not working in Release mode; random property names
-
-**Symptom:** Your Android app is working fine in Debug mode but fails in Release mode and the JSON properties have seemingly random names such as `a`, `b`, ...
-
-**Reason:** You probably have not configured ProGuard / R8 correctly
-
-**Solution:** Make sure you have configured ProGuard / R8 correctly to preserve the names of your fields. See the [Android example](examples/android-proguard-example/README.md) for more information.
-
-## <a id="android-app-broken-after-app-update"></a> Android app unable to parse JSON after app update
-
-**Symptom:** You released a new version of your Android app and it fails to parse JSON data created by the previous version of your app
-
-**Reason:** You probably have not configured ProGuard / R8 correctly; probably the fields names are being obfuscated and their naming changed between the versions of your app
-
-**Solution:** Make sure you have configured ProGuard / R8 correctly to preserve the names of your fields. See the [Android example](examples/android-proguard-example/README.md) for more information.
-
-If you want to preserve backward compatibility for you app you can use [`@SerializedName`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/annotations/SerializedName.html) on the fields to specify the obfuscated name as alternate, for example: `@SerializedName(value = "myprop", alternate = "a")`
-
-Normally ProGuard and R8 produce a mapping file, this makes it easier to find out the obfuscated field names instead of having to find them out through trial and error or other means. See the [Android Studio user guide](https://developer.android.com/studio/build/shrink-code.html#retracing) for more information.
-
-## <a id="default-field-values-missing"></a> Default field values not present after deserialization
-
-**Symptom:** You have assign default values to fields but after deserialization the fields have their standard value (such as `null` or `0`)
-
-**Reason:** Gson cannot invoke the constructor of your class and falls back to JDK `Unsafe` (or similar means)
-
-**Solution:** Make sure that the class:
-
-- is `static` (explicitly or implicitly when it is a top-level class)
-- has a no-args constructor
-
-Otherwise Gson will by default try to use JDK `Unsafe` or similar means to create an instance of your class without invoking the constructor and without running any initializers. You can also disable that behavior through [`GsonBuilder.disableJdkUnsafe()`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.html#disableJdkUnsafe()) to notice such issues early on.
-
-## <a id="anonymous-local-null"></a> `null` values for anonymous and local classes
-
-**Symptom:** Objects of a class are always serialized as JSON `null` / always deserialized as Java `null`
-
-**Reason:** The class you are serializing or deserializing is an anonymous or a local class (or you have specified a custom `ExclusionStrategy`)
-
-**Solution:** Convert the class to a `static` nested class. If the class is already `static` make sure you have not specified a Gson `ExclusionStrategy` which might exclude the class.
-
-Notes:
-
-- "double brace-initialization" also creates anonymous classes
-- Local record classes (feature added in Java 16) are supported by Gson and are not affected by this
-
-## <a id="map-key-wrong-json"></a> Map keys having unexpected format in JSON
-
-**Symptom:** JSON output for `Map` keys is unexpected / cannot be deserialized again
-
-**Reason:** The `Map` key type is 'complex' and you have not configured the `GsonBuilder` properly
-
-**Solution:** Use [`GsonBuilder.enableComplexMapKeySerialization()`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.html#enableComplexMapKeySerialization()). See also the [user guide](UserGuide.md#maps-examples) for more information.
-
-## <a id="malformed-json"></a> Parsing JSON fails with `MalformedJsonException`
-
-**Symptom:** JSON parsing fails with `MalformedJsonException`
-
-**Reason:** The JSON data is actually malformed
-
-**Solution:** During debugging, log the JSON data right before calling Gson methods or set a breakpoint to inspect the data and make sure it has the expected format. Sometimes APIs might return HTML error pages (instead of JSON data) when reaching rate limits or when other errors occur. Also read the location information of the `MalformedJsonException` exception message, it indicates where exactly in the document the malformed data was detected, including the [JSONPath](https://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/).
-
-For example, let's assume you want to deserialize the following JSON data:
-
-```json
-{
-  "languages": [
-    "English",
-    "French",
-  ]
-}
-```
-
-This will fail with an exception similar to this one: `MalformedJsonException: Use JsonReader.setLenient(true) to accept malformed JSON at line 5 column 4 path $.languages[2]`  
-The problem here is the trailing comma (`,`) after `"French"`, trailing commas are not allowed by the JSON specification. The location information "line 5 column 4" points to the `]` in the JSON data (with some slight inaccuracies) because Gson expected another value after `,` instead of the closing `]`. The JSONPath `$.languages[2]` in the exception message also points there: `$.` refers to the root object, `languages` refers to its member of that name and `[2]` refers to the (missing) third value in the JSON array value of that member (numbering starts at 0, so it is `[2]` instead of `[3]`).  
-The proper solution here is to fix the malformed JSON data.
-
-To spot syntax errors in the JSON data easily you can open it in an editor with support for JSON, for example Visual Studio Code. It will highlight within the JSON data the error location and show why the JSON data is considered invalid.
-
-## <a id="number-parsed-as-double"></a> Integral JSON number is parsed as `double`
-
-**Symptom:** JSON data contains an integral number such as `45` but Gson returns it as `double`
-
-**Reason:** When parsing a JSON number as `Object`, Gson will by default create always return a `double`
-
-**Solution:** Use [`GsonBuilder.setObjectToNumberStrategy`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.html#setObjectToNumberStrategy(com.google.gson.ToNumberStrategy)) to specify what type of number should be returned
-
-## <a id="default-lenient"></a> Malformed JSON not rejected
-
-**Symptom:** Gson parses malformed JSON without throwing any exceptions
-
-**Reason:** Due to legacy reasons Gson performs parsing by default in lenient mode
-
-**Solution:** See [`Gson` class documentation](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/Gson.html#default-lenient) section "Lenient JSON handling"
-
-Note: Even in non-lenient mode Gson deviates slightly from the JSON specification, see [`JsonReader.setLenient`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/stream/JsonReader.html#setLenient(boolean)) for more details.
-
-## <a id="unexpected-json-structure"></a> `IllegalStateException`: "Expected ... but was ..."
-
-**Symptom:** An `IllegalStateException` with a message in the form "Expected ... but was ..." is thrown
-
-**Reason:** The JSON data does not have the correct format
-
-**Solution:** Make sure that your classes correctly model the JSON data. Also during debugging log the JSON data right before calling Gson methods or set a breakpoint to inspect the data and make sure it has the expected format. Read the location information of the exception message, it indicates where exactly in the document the error occurred, including the [JSONPath](https://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/).
-
-For example, let's assume you have the following Java class:
-
-```java
-class WebPage {
-    String languages;
-}
-```
-
-And you want to deserialize the following JSON data:
-
-```json
-{
-  "languages": ["English", "French"]
-}
-```
-
-This will fail with an exception similar to this one: `IllegalStateException: Expected a string but was BEGIN_ARRAY at line 2 column 17 path $.languages`  
-This means Gson expected a JSON string value but found the beginning of a JSON array (`[`). The location information "line 2 column 17" points to the `[` in the JSON data (with some slight inaccuracies), so does the JSONPath `$.languages` in the exception message. It refers to the `languages` member of the root object (`$.`).  
-The solution here is to change in the `WebPage` class the field `String languages` to `List<String> languages`.
-
-## <a id="adapter-not-null-safe"></a> `IllegalStateException`: "Expected ... but was NULL"
-
-**Symptom:** An `IllegalStateException` with a message in the form "Expected ... but was NULL" is thrown
-
-**Reason:**
-
-- A built-in adapter does not support JSON null values
-- You have written a custom `TypeAdapter` which does not properly handle JSON null values
-
-**Solution:** If this occurs for a custom adapter you wrote, add code similar to the following at the beginning of its `read` method:
-
-```java
-@Override
-public MyClass read(JsonReader in) throws IOException {
-    if (in.peek() == JsonToken.NULL) {
-        in.nextNull();
-        return null;
-    }
-
-    ...
-}
-```
-
-Alternatively you can call [`nullSafe()`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html#nullSafe()) on the adapter instance you created.
-
-## <a id="serialize-nulls"></a> Properties missing in JSON
-
-**Symptom:** Properties are missing in the JSON output
-
-**Reason:** Gson by default omits JSON null from the output (or: ProGuard / R8 is not configured correctly and removed unused fields)
-
-**Solution:** Use [`GsonBuilder.serializeNulls()`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.html#serializeNulls())
-
-Note: Gson does not support anonymous and local classes and will serialize them as JSON null, see the [related troubleshooting point](#null-values-for-anonymous-and-local-classes).
-
-## <a id="android-internal-fields"></a> JSON output changes for newer Android versions
-
-**Symptom:** The JSON output differs when running on newer Android versions
-
-**Reason:** You use Gson by accident to access internal fields of Android classes
-
-**Solution:** Write custom Gson [`TypeAdapter`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html) implementations for the affected classes or change the type of your data
-
-**Explanation:**
-
-When no built-in adapter for a type exists and no custom adapter has been registered, Gson falls back to using reflection to access the fields of a class (including `private` ones). Most likely you are experiencing this issue because you (by accident) rely on the reflection-based adapter for Android classes. That should be avoided because you make yourself dependent on the implementation details of these classes which could change at any point.
-
-If you want to prevent using reflection on third-party classes in the future you can write your own [`ReflectionAccessFilter`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/ReflectionAccessFilter.html) or use one of the predefined ones, such as `ReflectionAccessFilter.BLOCK_ALL_PLATFORM`.
-
-## <a id="json-static-fields"></a> JSON output contains values of `static` fields
-
-**Symptom:** The JSON output contains values of `static` fields
-
-**Reason:** You used `GsonBuilder.excludeFieldsWithModifiers` to overwrite the default excluded modifiers
-
-**Solution:** When calling `GsonBuilder.excludeFieldsWithModifiers` you overwrite the default excluded modifiers. Therefore, you have to explicitly exclude `static` fields if desired. This can be done by adding `Modifier.STATIC` as additional argument.
-
-## <a id="no-such-method-error"></a> `NoSuchMethodError` when calling Gson methods
-
-**Symptom:** A `java.lang.NoSuchMethodError` is thrown when trying to call certain Gson methods
-
-**Reason:**
-
-- You have multiple versions of Gson on your classpath
-- Or, the Gson version you compiled against is different from the one on your classpath
-- Or, you are using a code shrinking tool such as ProGuard or R8 which removed methods from Gson
-
-**Solution:** First disable any code shrinking tools such as ProGuard or R8 and check if the issue persists. If not, you have to tweak the configuration of that tool to not modify Gson classes. Otherwise verify that the Gson JAR on your classpath is the same you are compiling against, and that there is only one Gson JAR on your classpath. See [this Stack Overflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/q/227486) to find out where a class is loaded from. For example, for debugging you could include the following code:
-
-```java
-System.out.println(Gson.class.getProtectionDomain().getCodeSource().getLocation());
-```
-
-If that fails with a `NullPointerException` you have to try one of the other ways to find out where a class is loaded from.
-
-## <a id="duplicate-fields"></a> `IllegalArgumentException`: 'Class ... declares multiple JSON fields named '...''
-
-**Symptom:** An exception with the message 'Class ... declares multiple JSON fields named '...'' is thrown
-
-**Reason:**
-
-- The name you have specified with a [`@SerializedName`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/annotations/SerializedName.html) annotation for a field collides with the name of another field
-- The [`FieldNamingStrategy`](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/FieldNamingStrategy.html) you have specified produces conflicting field names
-- A field of your class has the same name as the field of a superclass
-
-Gson prevents multiple fields with the same name because during deserialization it would be ambiguous for which field the JSON data should be deserialized. For serialization it would cause the same field to appear multiple times in JSON. While the JSON specification permits this, it is likely that the application parsing the JSON data will not handle it correctly.
-
-**Solution:** First identify the fields with conflicting names based on the exception message. Then decide if you want to rename one of them using the [`@SerializedName`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/annotations/SerializedName.html) annotation, or if you want to [exclude](UserGuide.md#excluding-fields-from-serialization-and-deserialization) one of them. When excluding one of the fields you have to include it for both serialization and deserialization (even if your application only performs one of these actions) because the duplicate field check cannot differentiate between these actions.
-
-## <a id="java-lang-class-unsupported"></a> `UnsupportedOperationException` when serializing or deserializing `java.lang.Class`
-
-**Symptom:** An `UnsupportedOperationException` is thrown when trying to serialize or deserialize `java.lang.Class`
-
-**Reason:** Gson intentionally does not permit serializing and deserializing `java.lang.Class` for security reasons. Otherwise a malicious user could make your application load an arbitrary class from the classpath and, depending on what your application does with the `Class`, in the worst case perform a remote code execution attack.
-
-**Solution:** First check if you really need to serialize or deserialize a `Class`. Often it is possible to use string aliases and then map them to the known `Class`; you could write a custom [`TypeAdapter`](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html) to do this. If the `Class` values are not known in advance, try to introduce a common base class or interface for all these classes and then verify that the deserialized class is a subclass. For example assuming the base class is called `MyBaseClass`, your custom `TypeAdapter` should load the class like this:
-
-```java
-Class.forName(jsonString, false, getClass().getClassLoader()).asSubclass(MyBaseClass.class)
-```
-
-This will not initialize arbitrary classes, and it will throw a `ClassCastException` if the loaded class is not the same as or a subclass of `MyBaseClass`.
-
-## <a id="type-token-raw"></a> `IllegalStateException`: 'TypeToken must be created with a type argument' <br> `RuntimeException`: 'Missing type parameter'
-
-**Symptom:** An `IllegalStateException` with the message 'TypeToken must be created with a type argument' is thrown.  
-For older Gson versions a `RuntimeException` with message 'Missing type parameter' is thrown.
-
-**Reason:**
-
-- You created a `TypeToken` without type argument, for example `new TypeToken() {}` (note the missing `<...>`). You always have to provide the type argument, for example like this: `new TypeToken<List<String>>() {}`. Normally the compiler will also emit a 'raw types' warning when you forget the `<...>`.
-- You are using a code shrinking tool such as ProGuard or R8 (Android app builds normally have this enabled by default) but have not configured it correctly for usage with Gson.
-
-**Solution:** When you are using a code shrinking tool such as ProGuard or R8 you have to adjust your configuration to include the following rules:
-
-```
-# Keep generic signatures; needed for correct type resolution
--keepattributes Signature
-
-# Keep class TypeToken (respectively its generic signature)
--keep class com.google.gson.reflect.TypeToken { *; }
-
-# Keep any (anonymous) classes extending TypeToken
--keep class * extends com.google.gson.reflect.TypeToken
-```
-
-See also the [Android example](examples/android-proguard-example/README.md) for more information.
-
-Note: For newer Gson versions these rules might be applied automatically; make sure you are using the latest Gson version and the latest version of the code shrinking tool.
-
-## <a id="r8-abstract-class"></a> `JsonIOException`: 'Abstract classes can't be instantiated!' (R8)
-
-**Symptom:** A `JsonIOException` with the message 'Abstract classes can't be instantiated!' is thrown; the class mentioned in the exception message is not actually `abstract` in your source code, and you are using the code shrinking tool R8 (Android app builds normally have this configured by default).
-
-**Reason:** The code shrinking tool R8 performs optimizations where it removes the no-args constructor from a class and makes the class `abstract`. Due to this Gson cannot create an instance of the class.
-
-**Solution:** Make sure the class has a no-args constructor, then adjust your R8 configuration file to keep the constructor of the class. For example:
-
-```
-# Keep the no-args constructor of the deserialized class
--keepclassmembers class com.example.MyClass {
-  <init>();
-}
-```
-
-For Android you can add this rule to the `proguard-rules.pro` file, see also the [Android documentation](https://developer.android.com/build/shrink-code#keep-code). In case the class name in the exception message is obfuscated, see the Android documentation about [retracing](https://developer.android.com/build/shrink-code#retracing).
-
-Note: If the class which you are trying to deserialize is actually abstract, then this exception is probably unrelated to R8 and you will have to implement a custom [`InstanceCreator`](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/InstanceCreator.html) or [`TypeAdapter`](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html) which creates an instance of a non-abstract subclass of the class.

+
+## <a id="class-cast-exception"></a> `ClassCastException` when using deserialized object
+
+**Symptom:** `ClassCastException` is thrown when accessing an object deserialized by Gson
+
+**Reason:** Your code is most likely not type-safe
+
+**Solution:** Make sure your code adheres to the following:
+
+- Avoid raw types: Instead of calling `fromJson(..., List.class)`, create for example a `TypeToken<List<MyClass>>`.
+  See the [user guide](UserGuide.md#collections-examples) for more information.
+- When using `TypeToken` prefer the `Gson.fromJson` overloads with `TypeToken` parameter such as [`fromJson(Reader, TypeToken)`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/Gson.html#fromJson(java.io.Reader,com.google.gson.reflect.TypeToken)).
+  The overloads with `Type` parameter do not provide any type-safety guarantees.
+- When using `TypeToken` make sure you don't capture a type variable. For example avoid something like `new TypeToken<List<T>>()` (where `T` is a type variable). Due to Java type erasure the actual type of `T` is not available at runtime. Refactor your code to pass around `TypeToken` instances or use [`TypeToken.getParameterized(...)`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/reflect/TypeToken.html#getParameterized(java.lang.reflect.Type,java.lang.reflect.Type...)), for example `TypeToken.getParameterized(List.class, elementClass)`.
+
+## <a id="reflection-inaccessible"></a> `InaccessibleObjectException`: 'module ... does not "opens ..." to unnamed module'
+
+**Symptom:** An exception with a message in the form 'module ... does not "opens ..." to unnamed module' is thrown
+
+**Reason:** You use Gson by accident to access internal fields of third-party classes
+
+**Solution:** Write custom Gson [`TypeAdapter`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html) implementations for the affected classes or change the type of your data. If this occurs for a field in one of your classes which you did not actually want to serialize or deserialize in the first place, you can exclude that field, see the [user guide](UserGuide.md#excluding-fields-from-serialization-and-deserialization).
+
+**Explanation:**
+
+When no built-in adapter for a type exists and no custom adapter has been registered, Gson falls back to using reflection to access the fields of a class (including `private` ones). Most likely you are seeing this error because you (by accident) rely on the reflection-based adapter for third-party classes. That should be avoided because you make yourself dependent on the implementation details of these classes which could change at any point. For the JDK it is also not possible anymore to access internal fields using reflection starting with JDK 17, see [JEP 403](https://openjdk.org/jeps/403).
+
+If you want to prevent using reflection on third-party classes in the future you can write your own [`ReflectionAccessFilter`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/ReflectionAccessFilter.html) or use one of the predefined ones, such as `ReflectionAccessFilter.BLOCK_ALL_PLATFORM`.
+
+## <a id="reflection-inaccessible-to-module-gson"></a> `InaccessibleObjectException`: 'module ... does not "opens ..." to module com.google.gson'
+
+**Symptom:** An exception with a message in the form 'module ... does not "opens ..." to module com.google.gson' is thrown
+
+**Reason:**
+
+- If the reported package is your own package then you have not configured the module declaration of your project to allow Gson to use reflection on your classes.
+- If the reported package is from a third party library or the JDK see [this troubleshooting point](#inaccessibleobjectexception-module--does-not-opens--to-unnamed-module).
+
+**Solution:** Make sure the `module-info.java` file of your project allows Gson to use reflection on your classes, for example:
+
+```java
+module mymodule {
+    requires com.google.gson;
+
+    opens mypackage to com.google.gson;
+}
+```
+
+Or in case this occurs for a field in one of your classes which you did not actually want to serialize or deserialize in the first place, you can exclude that field, see the [user guide](UserGuide.md#excluding-fields-from-serialization-and-deserialization).
+
+## <a id="android-app-random-names"></a> Android app not working in Release mode; random property names
+
+**Symptom:** Your Android app is working fine in Debug mode but fails in Release mode and the JSON properties have seemingly random names such as `a`, `b`, ...
+
+**Reason:** You probably have not configured ProGuard / R8 correctly
+
+**Solution:** Make sure you have configured ProGuard / R8 correctly to preserve the names of your fields. See the [Android example](examples/android-proguard-example/README.md) for more information.
+
+## <a id="android-app-broken-after-app-update"></a> Android app unable to parse JSON after app update
+
+**Symptom:** You released a new version of your Android app and it fails to parse JSON data created by the previous version of your app
+
+**Reason:** You probably have not configured ProGuard / R8 correctly; probably the fields names are being obfuscated and their naming changed between the versions of your app
+
+**Solution:** Make sure you have configured ProGuard / R8 correctly to preserve the names of your fields. See the [Android example](examples/android-proguard-example/README.md) for more information.
+
+If you want to preserve backward compatibility for you app you can use [`@SerializedName`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/annotations/SerializedName.html) on the fields to specify the obfuscated name as alternate, for example: `@SerializedName(value = "myprop", alternate = "a")`
+
+Normally ProGuard and R8 produce a mapping file, this makes it easier to find out the obfuscated field names instead of having to find them out through trial and error or other means. See the [Android Studio user guide](https://developer.android.com/studio/build/shrink-code.html#retracing) for more information.
+
+## <a id="default-field-values-missing"></a> Default field values not present after deserialization
+
+**Symptom:** You have assign default values to fields but after deserialization the fields have their standard value (such as `null` or `0`)
+
+**Reason:** Gson cannot invoke the constructor of your class and falls back to JDK `Unsafe` (or similar means)
+
+**Solution:** Make sure that the class:
+
+- is `static` (explicitly or implicitly when it is a top-level class)
+- has a no-args constructor
+
+Otherwise Gson will by default try to use JDK `Unsafe` or similar means to create an instance of your class without invoking the constructor and without running any initializers. You can also disable that behavior through [`GsonBuilder.disableJdkUnsafe()`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.html#disableJdkUnsafe()) to notice such issues early on.
+
+## <a id="anonymous-local-null"></a> `null` values for anonymous and local classes
+
+**Symptom:** Objects of a class are always serialized as JSON `null` / always deserialized as Java `null`
+
+**Reason:** The class you are serializing or deserializing is an anonymous or a local class (or you have specified a custom `ExclusionStrategy`)
+
+**Solution:** Convert the class to a `static` nested class. If the class is already `static` make sure you have not specified a Gson `ExclusionStrategy` which might exclude the class.
+
+Notes:
+
+- "double brace-initialization" also creates anonymous classes
+- Local record classes (feature added in Java 16) are supported by Gson and are not affected by this
+
+## <a id="map-key-wrong-json"></a> Map keys having unexpected format in JSON
+
+**Symptom:** JSON output for `Map` keys is unexpected / cannot be deserialized again
+
+**Reason:** The `Map` key type is 'complex' and you have not configured the `GsonBuilder` properly
+
+**Solution:** Use [`GsonBuilder.enableComplexMapKeySerialization()`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.html#enableComplexMapKeySerialization()). See also the [user guide](UserGuide.md#maps-examples) for more information.
+
+## <a id="malformed-json"></a> Parsing JSON fails with `MalformedJsonException`
+
+**Symptom:** JSON parsing fails with `MalformedJsonException`
+
+**Reason:** The JSON data is actually malformed
+
+**Solution:** During debugging, log the JSON data right before calling Gson methods or set a breakpoint to inspect the data and make sure it has the expected format. Sometimes APIs might return HTML error pages (instead of JSON data) when reaching rate limits or when other errors occur. Also read the location information of the `MalformedJsonException` exception message, it indicates where exactly in the document the malformed data was detected, including the [JSONPath](https://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/).
+
+For example, let's assume you want to deserialize the following JSON data:
+
+```json
+{
+  "languages": [
+    "English",
+    "French",
+  ]
+}
+```
+
+This will fail with an exception similar to this one: `MalformedJsonException: Use JsonReader.setLenient(true) to accept malformed JSON at line 5 column 4 path $.languages[2]`  
+The problem here is the trailing comma (`,`) after `"French"`, trailing commas are not allowed by the JSON specification. The location information "line 5 column 4" points to the `]` in the JSON data (with some slight inaccuracies) because Gson expected another value after `,` instead of the closing `]`. The JSONPath `$.languages[2]` in the exception message also points there: `$.` refers to the root object, `languages` refers to its member of that name and `[2]` refers to the (missing) third value in the JSON array value of that member (numbering starts at 0, so it is `[2]` instead of `[3]`).  
+The proper solution here is to fix the malformed JSON data.
+
+To spot syntax errors in the JSON data easily you can open it in an editor with support for JSON, for example Visual Studio Code. It will highlight within the JSON data the error location and show why the JSON data is considered invalid.
+
+## <a id="number-parsed-as-double"></a> Integral JSON number is parsed as `double`
+
+**Symptom:** JSON data contains an integral number such as `45` but Gson returns it as `double`
+
+**Reason:** When parsing a JSON number as `Object`, Gson will by default create always return a `double`
+
+**Solution:** Use [`GsonBuilder.setObjectToNumberStrategy`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.html#setObjectToNumberStrategy(com.google.gson.ToNumberStrategy)) to specify what type of number should be returned
+
+## <a id="default-lenient"></a> Malformed JSON not rejected
+
+**Symptom:** Gson parses malformed JSON without throwing any exceptions
+
+**Reason:** Due to legacy reasons Gson performs parsing by default in lenient mode
+
+**Solution:** See [`Gson` class documentation](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/Gson.html#default-lenient) section "Lenient JSON handling"
+
+Note: Even in non-lenient mode Gson deviates slightly from the JSON specification, see [`JsonReader.setLenient`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/stream/JsonReader.html#setLenient(boolean)) for more details.
+
+## <a id="unexpected-json-structure"></a> `IllegalStateException`: "Expected ... but was ..."
+
+**Symptom:** An `IllegalStateException` with a message in the form "Expected ... but was ..." is thrown
+
+**Reason:** The JSON data does not have the correct format
+
+**Solution:** Make sure that your classes correctly model the JSON data. Also during debugging log the JSON data right before calling Gson methods or set a breakpoint to inspect the data and make sure it has the expected format. Read the location information of the exception message, it indicates where exactly in the document the error occurred, including the [JSONPath](https://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/).
+
+For example, let's assume you have the following Java class:
+
+```java
+class WebPage {
+    String languages;
+}
+```
+
+And you want to deserialize the following JSON data:
+
+```json
+{
+  "languages": ["English", "French"]
+}
+```
+
+This will fail with an exception similar to this one: `IllegalStateException: Expected a string but was BEGIN_ARRAY at line 2 column 17 path $.languages`  
+This means Gson expected a JSON string value but found the beginning of a JSON array (`[`). The location information "line 2 column 17" points to the `[` in the JSON data (with some slight inaccuracies), so does the JSONPath `$.languages` in the exception message. It refers to the `languages` member of the root object (`$.`).  
+The solution here is to change in the `WebPage` class the field `String languages` to `List<String> languages`.
+
+## <a id="adapter-not-null-safe"></a> `IllegalStateException`: "Expected ... but was NULL"
+
+**Symptom:** An `IllegalStateException` with a message in the form "Expected ... but was NULL" is thrown
+
+**Reason:**
+
+- A built-in adapter does not support JSON null values
+- You have written a custom `TypeAdapter` which does not properly handle JSON null values
+
+**Solution:** If this occurs for a custom adapter you wrote, add code similar to the following at the beginning of its `read` method:
+
+```java
+@Override
+public MyClass read(JsonReader in) throws IOException {
+    if (in.peek() == JsonToken.NULL) {
+        in.nextNull();
+        return null;
+    }
+
+    ...
+}
+```
+
+Alternatively you can call [`nullSafe()`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html#nullSafe()) on the adapter instance you created.
+
+## <a id="serialize-nulls"></a> Properties missing in JSON
+
+**Symptom:** Properties are missing in the JSON output
+
+**Reason:** Gson by default omits JSON null from the output (or: ProGuard / R8 is not configured correctly and removed unused fields)
+
+**Solution:** Use [`GsonBuilder.serializeNulls()`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.html#serializeNulls())
+
+Note: Gson does not support anonymous and local classes and will serialize them as JSON null, see the [related troubleshooting point](#null-values-for-anonymous-and-local-classes).
+
+## <a id="android-internal-fields"></a> JSON output changes for newer Android versions
+
+**Symptom:** The JSON output differs when running on newer Android versions
+
+**Reason:** You use Gson by accident to access internal fields of Android classes
+
+**Solution:** Write custom Gson [`TypeAdapter`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html) implementations for the affected classes or change the type of your data
+
+**Explanation:**
+
+When no built-in adapter for a type exists and no custom adapter has been registered, Gson falls back to using reflection to access the fields of a class (including `private` ones). Most likely you are experiencing this issue because you (by accident) rely on the reflection-based adapter for Android classes. That should be avoided because you make yourself dependent on the implementation details of these classes which could change at any point.
+
+If you want to prevent using reflection on third-party classes in the future you can write your own [`ReflectionAccessFilter`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/ReflectionAccessFilter.html) or use one of the predefined ones, such as `ReflectionAccessFilter.BLOCK_ALL_PLATFORM`.
+
+## <a id="json-static-fields"></a> JSON output contains values of `static` fields
+
+**Symptom:** The JSON output contains values of `static` fields
+
+**Reason:** You used `GsonBuilder.excludeFieldsWithModifiers` to overwrite the default excluded modifiers
+
+**Solution:** When calling `GsonBuilder.excludeFieldsWithModifiers` you overwrite the default excluded modifiers. Therefore, you have to explicitly exclude `static` fields if desired. This can be done by adding `Modifier.STATIC` as additional argument.
+
+## <a id="no-such-method-error"></a> `NoSuchMethodError` when calling Gson methods
+
+**Symptom:** A `java.lang.NoSuchMethodError` is thrown when trying to call certain Gson methods
+
+**Reason:**
+
+- You have multiple versions of Gson on your classpath
+- Or, the Gson version you compiled against is different from the one on your classpath
+- Or, you are using a code shrinking tool such as ProGuard or R8 which removed methods from Gson
+
+**Solution:** First disable any code shrinking tools such as ProGuard or R8 and check if the issue persists. If not, you have to tweak the configuration of that tool to not modify Gson classes. Otherwise verify that the Gson JAR on your classpath is the same you are compiling against, and that there is only one Gson JAR on your classpath. See [this Stack Overflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/q/227486) to find out where a class is loaded from. For example, for debugging you could include the following code:
+
+```java
+System.out.println(Gson.class.getProtectionDomain().getCodeSource().getLocation());
+```
+
+If that fails with a `NullPointerException` you have to try one of the other ways to find out where a class is loaded from.
+
+## <a id="duplicate-fields"></a> `IllegalArgumentException`: 'Class ... declares multiple JSON fields named '...''
+
+**Symptom:** An exception with the message 'Class ... declares multiple JSON fields named '...'' is thrown
+
+**Reason:**
+
+- The name you have specified with a [`@SerializedName`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/annotations/SerializedName.html) annotation for a field collides with the name of another field
+- The [`FieldNamingStrategy`](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/FieldNamingStrategy.html) you have specified produces conflicting field names
+- A field of your class has the same name as the field of a superclass
+
+Gson prevents multiple fields with the same name because during deserialization it would be ambiguous for which field the JSON data should be deserialized. For serialization it would cause the same field to appear multiple times in JSON. While the JSON specification permits this, it is likely that the application parsing the JSON data will not handle it correctly.
+
+**Solution:** First identify the fields with conflicting names based on the exception message. Then decide if you want to rename one of them using the [`@SerializedName`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/annotations/SerializedName.html) annotation, or if you want to [exclude](UserGuide.md#excluding-fields-from-serialization-and-deserialization) one of them. When excluding one of the fields you have to include it for both serialization and deserialization (even if your application only performs one of these actions) because the duplicate field check cannot differentiate between these actions.
+
+## <a id="java-lang-class-unsupported"></a> `UnsupportedOperationException` when serializing or deserializing `java.lang.Class`
+
+**Symptom:** An `UnsupportedOperationException` is thrown when trying to serialize or deserialize `java.lang.Class`
+
+**Reason:** Gson intentionally does not permit serializing and deserializing `java.lang.Class` for security reasons. Otherwise a malicious user could make your application load an arbitrary class from the classpath and, depending on what your application does with the `Class`, in the worst case perform a remote code execution attack.
+
+**Solution:** First check if you really need to serialize or deserialize a `Class`. Often it is possible to use string aliases and then map them to the known `Class`; you could write a custom [`TypeAdapter`](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html) to do this. If the `Class` values are not known in advance, try to introduce a common base class or interface for all these classes and then verify that the deserialized class is a subclass. For example assuming the base class is called `MyBaseClass`, your custom `TypeAdapter` should load the class like this:
+
+```java
+Class.forName(jsonString, false, getClass().getClassLoader()).asSubclass(MyBaseClass.class)
+```
+
+This will not initialize arbitrary classes, and it will throw a `ClassCastException` if the loaded class is not the same as or a subclass of `MyBaseClass`.
+
+## <a id="type-token-raw"></a> `IllegalStateException`: 'TypeToken must be created with a type argument' <br> `RuntimeException`: 'Missing type parameter'
+
+**Symptom:** An `IllegalStateException` with the message 'TypeToken must be created with a type argument' is thrown.  
+For older Gson versions a `RuntimeException` with message 'Missing type parameter' is thrown.
+
+**Reason:**
+
+- You created a `TypeToken` without type argument, for example `new TypeToken() {}` (note the missing `<...>`). You always have to provide the type argument, for example like this: `new TypeToken<List<String>>() {}`. Normally the compiler will also emit a 'raw types' warning when you forget the `<...>`.
+- You are using a code shrinking tool such as ProGuard or R8 (Android app builds normally have this enabled by default) but have not configured it correctly for usage with Gson.
+
+**Solution:** When you are using a code shrinking tool such as ProGuard or R8 you have to adjust your configuration to include the following rules:
+
+```
+# Keep generic signatures; needed for correct type resolution
+-keepattributes Signature
+
+# Keep class TypeToken (respectively its generic signature)
+-keep class com.google.gson.reflect.TypeToken { *; }
+
+# Keep any (anonymous) classes extending TypeToken
+-keep class * extends com.google.gson.reflect.TypeToken
+```
+
+See also the [Android example](examples/android-proguard-example/README.md) for more information.
+
+Note: For newer Gson versions these rules might be applied automatically; make sure you are using the latest Gson version and the latest version of the code shrinking tool.
+
+## <a id="r8-abstract-class"></a> `JsonIOException`: 'Abstract classes can't be instantiated!' (R8)
+
+**Symptom:** A `JsonIOException` with the message 'Abstract classes can't be instantiated!' is thrown; the class mentioned in the exception message is not actually `abstract` in your source code, and you are using the code shrinking tool R8 (Android app builds normally have this configured by default).
+
+**Reason:** R8 can remove constructors and, in some optimizations, make classes `abstract`. This prevents Gson from creating instances. In some builds, R8 may retain synthetic or additional constructors even after making a class abstract, but instantiation will still fail.
+
+**Solution:** Prefer keeping all constructors of the affected class so R8 neither removes constructors nor changes abstractness when the rule applies. For example:
+
+```
+# Keep all constructors of the deserialized class and keep the class when the rule matches
+-keepclasseswithmembers class com.example.MyClass {
+  <init>(...);
+}
+```
+
+Notes and alternatives:
+
+- Kotlin classes commonly do not have a no-args constructor (for example `class MyClass(val s: String)`). Keeping all constructors avoids mismatches with rules that only keep `<init>()`. If you rely on constructor logic (initializers, default values), consider providing a no-args or secondary constructor that fits your deserialization needs.
+- If no suitable constructor is available, Gson may fall back to JDK Unsafe to create instances without invoking constructors. To detect this early, use [`GsonBuilder.disableJdkUnsafe()`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/GsonBuilder.html#disableJdkUnsafe()).
+- `-keepclasseswithmembers` keeps the class when the member pattern matches and retains the specified members. Compared to `-keepclassmembers`, it also prevents R8 from changing the class abstractness when the rule applies. If you want to unconditionally keep a class (and all its members), you can use `-keep class com.example.MyClass`.
+- As an Android-friendly alternative, annotate your model class or its constructor with `@Keep` to prevent removal by the shrinker. See the [Android documentation](https://developer.android.com/studio/write/annotations#keep).
+- Newer Gson versions ship default ProGuard/R8 rules that help retain constructors when Gson annotations are present on a class (see `gson/META-INF/proguard/gson.pro` in the JAR). If your class does not use Gson annotations, you may still need an explicit rule or `@Keep`.
+
+For Android you can add these rules to the `proguard-rules.pro` file, see also the [Android documentation](https://developer.android.com/build/shrink-code#keep-code). In case the class name in the exception message is obfuscated, see the Android documentation about [retracing](https://developer.android.com/build/shrink-code#retracing).
+
+Note: If the class which you are trying to deserialize is actually abstract, then this exception is unrelated to R8 and you will have to implement a custom [`InstanceCreator`](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/InstanceCreator.html) or [`TypeAdapter`](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/TypeAdapter.html) which creates an instance of a non-abstract subclass of the class.

+

+
+```
+-keepclasseswithmembers class com.example.MyClass {

+- If your model classes use Gson annotations (such as `@SerializedName`, `@Expose`, `@JsonAdapter`, `@Since`, `@Until`), newer Gson versions ship default rules that conditionally keep constructors when these annotations are present. This reduces the need for manual rules.
+- Kotlin classes often do not have a no-args constructor. Keeping all constructors avoids issues with rules that only keep `<init>()`. If you rely on constructor logic or default property values, consider adding a suitable constructor for deserialization.
+- As an alternative to shrinker rules, annotate classes or constructors with Android's `@Keep` to prevent removal by ProGuard/R8. See the [Android documentation](https://developer.android.com/studio/write/annotations#keep).
+- Ensure generic signatures are preserved when using `TypeToken`, and retain runtime-visible annotations where they influence Gson behavior. The shipped `gson.pro` covers common cases, but project-specific rules may still be required.
