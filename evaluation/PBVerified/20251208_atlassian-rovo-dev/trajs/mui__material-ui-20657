<problem_statement>
[TreeView] Expand/collapse node only when clicking on expand/collapse icon
- [x] I have searched the [issues](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui/issues) of this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.

## Summary 💡

When I click on a tree item that has children, the node expands, wherever I click on the line. While this behavior might be ok for most users, I would like to have the possibility to expand/collapse only when I click on the expand/collapse icon - not on the label.

## Motivation 🔦

In my project, I have a tree and I'd like to display a panel with information about a node when I click on it.
When my node does not have children, it is very easy to achieve this behavior. But when my node has children, it expends at the same time its information are displayed, which is not the behavior I want. So I lack a way to have a different behavior when I click on the label (display node info) and when I click on the expand/collapse icon (expand/collapse the node).

</problem_statement>

Do not stop until you have made code changes that resolve the problem statement. Do not ask for clarifications.

NEVER attempt to find the solution to the problem statement by searching future commits or branches in the repository.

STEP 1: EXPLORE WORKSPACE - Understanding the TreeView component structure

<thinking>
The problem statement is about the TreeView component in Material-UI. The user wants to have the ability to expand/collapse tree nodes only when clicking on the expand/collapse icon, not when clicking on the label. This would allow them to have different behaviors for clicking on the label (e.g., display node info) vs clicking on the icon (expand/collapse).

Let me first explore the TreeView component to understand its structure:
1. Find the TreeView and TreeItem components in the packages/material-ui-lab directory (since TreeView is typically in the lab package)
2. Understand how the expand/collapse behavior is currently implemented
3. Identify what changes need to be made to add this feature

Let me start by exploring the material-ui-lab package to find the TreeView component.

STEP 2: ANALYZE THE PROBLEM AND PLAN THE SOLUTION

<thinking>
Now I understand the current implementation. Let me analyze the problem:

**Current Behavior:**
In `TreeItem.js`, the `handleClick` function (lines 160-185) is attached to the entire content div (line 384). When clicked anywhere on the content (including the label), it:
1. Focuses the node
2. Toggles expansion if the node is expandable
3. Selects the node

**Desired Behavior:**
The user wants the ability to expand/collapse nodes ONLY when clicking on the expand/collapse icon, not when clicking on the label. This would allow them to:
- Click on the label to select the node (and trigger custom actions like displaying info)
- Click on the icon to expand/collapse the node

**Solution:**
I need to add a new prop to the TreeItem component that controls this behavior. Looking at similar patterns in Material-UI, I should add a prop like `onIconClick` or modify the behavior with a prop like `expandOnLabelClick` (defaulting to `true` for backward compatibility).

Actually, looking at the problem statement more carefully, the user wants to be able to:
1. Click on the label → select the node (display info)
2. Click on the icon → expand/collapse the node

The cleanest solution would be to add a prop to TreeItem called `onLabelClick` that allows users to handle label clicks separately, and/or add a prop to control whether clicking the label expands the node.

However, looking at this more carefully, I think the best approach is:
1. Add an `onLabelClick` prop to TreeItem that fires when the label is clicked
2. Add an `onIconClick` prop to TreeItem that fires when the icon is clicked

But actually, the simplest and most flexible solution would be to separate the click handlers for the icon and label, and allow the user to control whether clicking on the label expands the node. This can be done by:

1. Moving the icon into its own clickable element with its own handler
2. Making the label clickable separately
3. Adding a prop to control whether clicking the label should expand/collapse the node

Looking at the issue more carefully, I think the best solution is to add a prop called `onLabelClick` to TreeItem. When this prop is provided, clicking on the label will call this handler instead of (or in addition to) the default behavior. Additionally, we should add a prop called `onIconClick` for when the icon is clicked.

Actually, let me reconsider. The cleanest solution that matches the user's request is:
1. Add an `onLabelClick` prop to TreeItem - called when the label is clicked
2. Add an `onIconClick` prop to TreeItem - called when the icon is clicked

But this still doesn't solve the problem of preventing expansion when clicking the label. The user wants to be able to expand ONLY when clicking the icon.

The best solution is to separate the click handling:
1. The icon container should have its own click handler that toggles expansion
2. The label should have its own click handler that only selects (and calls onLabelClick if provided)
3. Add a prop to control whether clicking the label should also expand/collapse

Let me implement this by:
1. Adding an `onLabelClick` prop to TreeItem
2. Adding an `onIconClick` prop to TreeItem  
3. Separating the click handlers so that:
   - Clicking the icon toggles expansion and calls onIconClick
   - Clicking the label selects and calls onLabelClick
   - The current behavior (clicking anywhere expands) is preserved by default

Wait, I need to think about this more carefully. The current behavior is that clicking anywhere on the content (icon or label) does:
1. Focus the node
2. Toggle expansion (if expandable)
3. Select the node

The user wants:
1. Clicking on the icon → expand/collapse only
2. Clicking on the label → select only (and trigger custom actions)

So I need to:
1. Separate the click handlers for icon and label
2. Icon click: toggle expansion, focus
3. Label click: select, focus, call onLabelClick if provided

But this would be a breaking change in behavior. To maintain backward compatibility, I should add a prop that controls this behavior.

Looking at similar components and patterns, I think the best approach is:
1. Add an `onLabelClick` prop to TreeItem that is called when the label is clicked
2. Add an `onIconClick` prop to TreeItem that is called when the icon is clicked

Then, the user can use `event.stopPropagation()` in their handlers to prevent the default behavior, or we can add a prop to control whether clicking the label expands the node.

Actually, the simplest solution that matches the user's request is to separate the click handlers and let the user control the behavior through event handlers. Let me implement:

1. Add `onLabelClick` prop to TreeItem - called when label is clicked
2. Add `onIconClick` prop to TreeItem - called when icon is clicked

The icon click handler will:
- Stop propagation to prevent the content click handler from firing
- Toggle expansion
- Focus the node
- Call onIconClick if provided

The label click handler will:
- Stop propagation to prevent the content click handler from firing
- Select the node
- Focus the node
- Call onLabelClick if provided

The content click handler will remain as a fallback for any clicks that don't hit the icon or label directly.

Wait, I'm overcomplicating this. Let me look at the structure again:

```jsx
<div className={classes.content} onClick={handleClick}>
  <div className={classes.iconContainer}>{icon}</div>
  <Typography component="div" className={classes.label}>{label}</Typography>
</div>
```

The simplest solution is:
1. Add an `onLabelClick` prop
2. Add an `onIconClick` prop
3. Attach click handlers to the iconContainer and label elements
4. In the icon click handler, toggle expansion and call onIconClick
5. In the label click handler, select and call onLabelClick
6. Both handlers should stop propagation to prevent the content click handler from firing

But this changes the default behavior. To maintain backward compatibility, I should only change the behavior when the user provides the new props.

Actually, looking at this again, I think the cleanest solution is:
1. Keep the current behavior as default
2. Add an `onLabelClick` prop that, when provided, is called when the label is clicked
3. Add an `onIconClick` prop that, when provided, is called when the icon is clicked

The user can then use these props to implement their desired behavior. If they want to prevent expansion when clicking the label, they can use `event.stopPropagation()` in their `onLabelClick` handler.

But wait, that won't work because the click handler is on the content div, not on the label or icon. The events bubble up from the label/icon to the content div.

Let me think about this differently. The solution should be:
1. Move the click handling to the icon and label elements separately
2. Add `onLabelClick` and `onIconClick` props
3. The icon click handler toggles expansion
4. The label click handler selects
5. Both handlers focus the node

This changes the default behavior, but it's a more sensible default. Currently, clicking anywhere expands AND selects, which is the behavior the user is complaining about.

Actually, I realize I need to be more careful here. The current behavior is:
- Click anywhere on content → focus, expand (if expandable), select

The user wants:
- Click on icon → expand/collapse
- Click on label → select (and custom action)

So the solution is to separate these behaviors. But to maintain backward compatibility, I should add a prop that controls this.

Let me implement:
1. Add an `onLabelClick` prop to TreeItem
2. Add an `onIconClick` prop to TreeItem
3. Modify the click handling to:
   - When clicking on the icon: toggle expansion, focus, call onIconClick
   - When clicking on the label: select, focus, call onLabelClick
   - The current behavior is preserved when neither prop is provided

Actually, the simplest backward-compatible solution is:
1. Add `onLabelClick` prop - called when label is clicked
2. Add `onIconClick` prop - called when icon is clicked
3. Keep the current behavior, but also call these handlers when the respective elements are clicked

The user can then use `event.stopPropagation()` in their handlers to prevent the default behavior (expansion/selection).

Wait, that still won't work because the click handler is on the parent content div. The events will bubble up.

OK, let me implement this properly:
1. Add click handlers to the iconContainer and label elements
2. These handlers will call onIconClick and onLabelClick respectively
3. If the user wants to prevent expansion when clicking the label, they can call `event.stopPropagation()` in their onLabelClick handler
4. The content click handler will still fire if the event is not stopped

Actually, I realize the issue. The click handler is on the content div, which is the parent of both the icon and label. So clicks on the icon or label will bubble up to the content div and trigger the handleClick function.

The solution is:
1. Add click handlers to the iconContainer and label elements
2. In these handlers, call onIconClick/onLabelClick and optionally stop propagation
3. The content click handler will only fire if the event is not stopped

But this changes the default behavior. To maintain backward compatibility:
1. If onLabelClick is provided, attach a click handler to the label that calls onLabelClick
2. If onIconClick is provided, attach a click handler to the icon that calls onIconClick
3. The content click handler remains unchanged

The user can then use `event.stopPropagation()` in their handlers to prevent the default behavior.

Actually, I think the cleanest solution is to just add the `onLabelClick` and `onIconClick` props, and let the user decide whether to stop propagation. This is the most flexible approach and maintains backward compatibility.

Let me implement this:
1. Add `onLabelClick` prop to TreeItem
2. Add `onIconClick` prop to TreeItem
3. Attach click handlers to the label and iconContainer elements
4. These handlers call the respective props if provided
5. The user can call `event.stopPropagation()` to prevent the default behavior

This is the simplest and most flexible solution.

Let me now implement this in the code.
</thinking>

Now I understand the problem and have a plan. I need to:

1. Add `onLabelClick` prop to TreeItem - called when the label is clicked
2. Add `onIconClick` prop to TreeItem - called when the icon is clicked
3. Attach click handlers to the label and iconContainer elements
4. Update the TypeScript definitions

Let me implement these changes:
========================================================================================================================
AGENT:
I've analyzed the TreeItem component and understand the issue. The current behavior expands/collapses nodes when clicking anywhere on the content. I need to add onLabelClick and onIconClick props to allow users to handle clicks on the label and icon separately, enabling them to expand/collapse only when clicking the icon.
========================================================================================================================
AGENT:
STEP 3: IMPLEMENT THE CHANGES

<thinking>
Now I'll implement the changes to TreeItem.js:

1. Add `onLabelClick` and `onIconClick` to the destructured props
2. Create handlers for icon and label clicks
3. Attach these handlers to the respective elements
4. Update the TypeScript definitions in TreeItem.d.ts
5. Update the PropTypes

STEP 5: REVIEW CHANGES

<thinking>
Let me review all the changes I made to ensure they are correct and complete:

1. **TreeItem.js**:
   - Added `onIconClick` and `onLabelClick` to the destructured props
   - Created `handleIconClick` and `handleLabelClick` functions that call the respective props if provided
   - Attached `onClick={handleIconClick}` to the iconContainer div
   - Attached `onClick={handleLabelClick}` to the Typography (label) component
   - Added PropTypes for `onIconClick` and `onLabelClick`

2. **TreeItem.d.ts**:
   - Added `onIconClick?: React.MouseEventHandler` with documentation
   - Added `onLabelClick?: React.MouseEventHandler` with documentation

The implementation allows users to:
1. Use `onLabelClick` to handle clicks on the label
2. Use `onIconClick` to handle clicks on the icon
3. Call `event.stopPropagation()` in either handler to prevent the default behavior (expansion/selection)

This is exactly what the user requested - they can now:
- Click on the label → call `onLabelClick` (and optionally prevent expansion with `event.stopPropagation()`)
- Click on the icon → call `onIconClick` (and optionally prevent expansion with `event.stopPropagation()`)

The default behavior is preserved - if the user doesn't provide these handlers, the TreeItem works exactly as before.

Let me verify the final state of the files.

========================================================================================================================
AGENT:
I have successfully implemented the feature to allow expanding/collapsing TreeView nodes only when clicking on the expand/collapse icon.

## Summary of Changes

### 1. `packages/material-ui-lab/src/TreeItem/TreeItem.js`
- Added `onIconClick` and `onLabelClick` props to the component's destructured props
- Created `handleIconClick` function that calls `onIconClick` if provided
- Created `handleLabelClick` function that calls `onLabelClick` if provided
- Attached `onClick={handleIconClick}` to the icon container div
- Attached `onClick={handleLabelClick}` to the Typography (label) component
- Added PropTypes for both new props with documentation

### 2. `packages/material-ui-lab/src/TreeItem/TreeItem.d.ts`
- Added TypeScript definitions for `onIconClick?: React.MouseEventHandler`
- Added TypeScript definitions for `onLabelClick?: React.MouseEventHandler`
- Added JSDoc comments explaining how to use `event.stopPropagation()` to prevent the default behavior

## How to Use

Users can now implement the desired behavior by using the new props:

```jsx
<TreeItem
  nodeId="1"
  label="Parent"
  onLabelClick={(event) => {
    // Prevent expansion when clicking on the label
    event.stopPropagation();
    // Display node info or perform other actions
    console.log('Label clicked - show info panel');
  }}
  onIconClick={(event) => {
    // Icon click will still trigger expansion (default behavior)
    // Or you can also stop propagation here if needed
    console.log('Icon clicked - expanding/collapsing');
  }}
>
  <TreeItem nodeId="2" label="Child" />
</TreeItem>
```

This implementation:
1. Maintains backward compatibility - the default behavior is unchanged
2. Allows users to handle label and icon clicks separately
3. Enables users to prevent expansion when clicking the label by calling `event.stopPropagation()`
4. Provides proper TypeScript support with documentation
